9775825,3339,Burramys parvus,Critically Endangered,"B1ab(iii,v)+2ab(iii,v)",2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Critically Endangered because its extent of occurrence is less than 100 km², its area of occupancy is less than 10 km², the population is severely fragmented, and there is continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat and in the number of mature individuals.","This is the only Australian mammal species confined to alpine environments (Broome 2008). They occur in periglacial boulder fields (basalt, granite, granodiorites) overlain with mountain plum-pine <em>Podocarpus lawrenceii</em> heathland and adjacent alpine communities. The basalt boulderfields have the greatest population density. Mountain Pygmy Possums are nocturnal and terrestrial, but they are also adept climbers. It has a spring-summer diet composed predominantly of Bogong moths <em>Agrotis infusa</em> and other invertebrates with seeds and fruits important in late summer and autumn (Mansergh and Broome 1994). Females normally have one litter of 4 young following snowmelt in spring. All individuals accumulate subcutaneous fat during late summer and autumn and spend the winter in hibernation (about 7 months for adults and 5 months for juveniles; Geiser and Broome (1991)). Snow cover provides important insulation and protection to hibernating animals.","The extremely restricted habitat has been fragmented or destroyed by road construction, dam/aqueduct construction, and development of infrastructure for the downhill skiing industry. Approximately 50% of the habitat supporting the Mt. Bogong-Mt. Higginbotham population and 20% of the Kosciuszko habitat was burned in bushfires in January 2003, killing <em>Podocarpus</em> heathland aged from 50-400 years (L. Broome pers. comm.). The population at Mt. Buller suffers from fragmentation and subpopulations here and around ski resorts in the Kosciuszko area have declined severely since 2000 due to: habitat destruction, predation by feral cats, and possibly low snow cover. Predation by the introduced Red Fox is also a threat and the habitat is subject to weed invasion (e.g., willow <em>Salix</em> species). Bogong moths are migratory and have been found to carry arsenic from their breeding grounds in the Murray-Darling Basin to the mountains where it accumulates in food chains. Arsenic has been found in the scats of <em>B. parvus</em> and other small mammals, but the implications of this are as yet unknown (Green <em>et al.</em> 2001). <br/><br/>Marginalisation and loss of habitat and the severity of predation are predicted to increase with global warming. A recent trend of second litters following early snow melt has been observed at Mt. Buller (D. Heinze pers. comm.). Neither second litters nor their mothers are known to survive the winter because they are unable to accumulate the fat reserves necessary for successful hibernation through winter.","Common where they occur, but declining. The total population is estimated to number approximately 1,700 adult females and 550 adult males (Broome 2008).",Decreasing,"The Mountain Pygmy Possum is endemic to south-eastern Australia where it occurs as three isolated, genetically distinct populations: 1) between Mt. Bogong and Mt. Higginbotham, Victoria 2) at Mt. Buller, Victoria and 3) in the Kosciuszko region of New South Wales (Osborne <em>et al.</em> 2000). Its range is much smaller than the mapped distribution, and its area of occupancy is estimated to be less than 6 or 7 km² (Heinze <em>et al.</em> 2004; Broome 2008).

Monitoring of populations, diet, food supply (Bogong moths and seeds) and habitat in ski resorts and control areas and consequent on-ground protection and planning is ongoing; protocols that provide protection to populations have been developed within some ski resorts, legislative and operational protection of all habitat needs to be finalised. Habitat restoration is occurring in fragmented, burnt, and disturbed areas in ski resorts. Feral cat, fox, rabbit, and weed control has been initiated in some areas; genetic studies are nearing completion; establishment of a captive colony of the Mt. Buller population is under consideration.<br/><br/>Studies required include: determine effects of the ski industry (notably use of snow-grooming equipment over habitat) and loss of snow cover on hibernation and over-winter survival; investigate Bogong moth population dynamics and pesticide residues, the possibility of competition or predation by co-occuring small mammal species, social dynamics, reproductive success, and captive husbandry techniques; continue research aimed at producing reliable metapopulation dynamics and viability models.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

However, the populations that are in the decline, such as in the Pilbara and those in central Queensland, require close monitoring.","<em>L. c. conspicillatus</em> occurs throughout Barrow Island and shelters in large <em>Triodia</em> hummocks (Burbidge and Johnson 2008; A. Burbidge pers. comm.).<br/><br/><em>L. c. leichardti</em> occupies a wide variety of habitat types including: open forests, open woodland, tall shrublands, tussock grasslands and hummock grasslands. In the central part of its range in Northern Territory, it particularly favours <em>Acacia shirleyi</em>/<em>Macropteranthes kekwickii</em> thickets (Lancewood/Bullwaddy) with an open understorey. In the drier southern parts of its range it commonly occupies spinifex (<em>Triodia</em> spp.) sandplains interspersed with low shrubs and a diversity of either soft grasses, sedges, or forb species. In the northern part of its range in Northern Territory and in Queensland it occupies open woodlands or open forests (generally <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp., <em>Erythrophleum chlorostachys</em>, <em>Terminalia canescens</em> or <em>Lysiphyllum cunninghamii</em>), with a tussock grass understorey. Predominant grass species in central and northern Queensland include <em>Themeda triandra</em>, <em>Bothriocloa ewartiana</em> and <em>Heteropogon contortus</em>. This species frequently feeds in areas regenerating after fire (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).<br/><br/>It is generally a solitary species, but up to three may be seen feeding together. Breeding occurs throughout the year. Young leave the pouch at about five months, and females become reproductively active at twelve months (Langford and Pavey 2002).","The reasons for decline of <em>L. c. leichardti</em> are probably many and varied in different parts of the range (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). There is little direct evidence to determine the exact factors, but these probably include introduced predators (foxes in southern parts of the range and possibly cats), and competitors, the pastoral industry (particularly sheep in the Pilbara and cattle in the central southern Kimberley and Queensland) and changes in fire regimes (central Australia). In central Queensland, intensive land use coupled with the effects of the long drought conditions has led to a decrease in the number of shelter sites (tussock grasses reduced in structure) and thereby increasing the probability of predation by dingoes (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Here, too, the species seems to be stable where stocking rates are conservative: property sizes in the area are large enough to have flexible stocking rates and allow for paddock spelling. Fire is also used as a management tool – summer mosaic burns of which the stock and wallabies take advantage. Properties in the area have been managed in a constant manner for the last 60 years (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). In the Northern Territory, Spectacled Hare-wallaby populations seem secure in the belt of Lancewood/Bullwaddy woodland extending between 16<sup>o</sup> and 18<sup>o</sup> S.

In Western Australia it is now rare and reduced to a few isolated populations in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions (very rare in the latter) (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). In Northern Territory it still occurs sparsely in the Tanami bioregion; near Newcastle Waters it is found in Acacia woodland, whereas near Borroloola in the Gulf Coastal bioregion it occurs in savannah woodland (Langford and Pavey 2002).

There are less than 100 individuals in New South Wales, and the size of the population in Queensland is unknown.<br/><br/>The overall population trend of the species is unknown. There has been evidence of a general population decline in the Flinders Ranges and a number of colonies in the Olary Hills and Gawler Ranges have gone extinct (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). However, populations have dramatically increased in some areas over the last few decades due to fox and goat control measures (including in the Olary Hills, and the Flinders and Gawler Ranges).

The rate of decline is not well resolved, but suspected to be &gt;30% over a 21 year (=three generation) period. Hence it qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby is closely associated with rugged rocky areas, including rock faces and outcrops with boulders, ledges and caves (Short 1992; Menkhorst and Hynes 2011); however this association may be an artefact reflecting retreat from a far broader habitat distribution since European settlement (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011). The rocky sites now occupied may occur in a range of vegetation types including rainforests, eucalypt forests and woodlands (Eldridge and Close 2008). At night, Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies move from their daytime shelter sites to a foraging area, typically using a habitual route. Home range size varies from 6-30 hectares (Short 1992), although more recent radio-tracking data demonstrate that movements of c. 500 m distance per night are relatively common, suggesting home range sizes may be larger than previously published values (T. Soderquist <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Foraging areas may include forests, woodlands and pastures. The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby has a mixed diet: grass is the main item, but flowers, forbs, leaves, fruit, bark and fungi are also eaten (Short 1989; Menkhorst and Hynes 2011).<br/><br/>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby lives in colonies, usually comprising fewer than 30 individuals (Piggott <em>et al</em>. 2006; Hazlitt <em>et al</em>. 2006a), with many colonies now comprising just a few individuals (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011). Habitat clearance and predation away from shelter sites lead to a decreased rate of successful dispersal between colonies, and increased risks of inbreeding impacts (Hazlitt <em>et al</em>. 2006b).<br/><br/>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby can breed throughout the year, although births peak from February to May (Eldridge and Close 2008), and at least in some colonies breeding may be highly synchronized (Wynd <em>et al</em>. 2006). Sexual maturity is reached at about 1.5-2 years (longer for males: Lee and Ward 1989). Longevity may reach at least 14 years (reported for the Jenolan subpopulation: T. Soderquist <em>pers. comm</em>.) (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2009); although the maximum recorded in the wild in studies of Victorian subpopulations is 8 years (L. Clausen <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Generation length is taken here as 7-8 years.</p><p></p>","There is a lack of data about the threats to the Brush-tailed Rock Wallaby (Eldridge and Close 2008). Predation by introduced foxes and competition with introduced goats are likely to be the greatest threats. Foxes prey on young rock wallabies and probably limit dispersal as well as recruitment. Introduced dogs and cats are also probably threats, but the habitat in which this species lives is not well suited to these predators. Habitat fragmentation and land clearance between colonies is also thought to limit dispersal and reduce numbers of individuals by exposing rock wallabies to higher rates of predation. As colony isolation increases so does the risk of inbreeding (Hazlitt <em>et al.</em> 2006a,b). <br/><br/>Hunting was perhaps the main historical factor in reducing the population and range of this species. A sustained commercially-driven period of hunting led to the decline of many populations and local extinctions, and may have been the primary cause of the initial decline, at least in central and southern New South Wales. Bounties were paid on over half a million rock-wallabies between 1894 and 1914 (Short and Milkovits 1990) and there was an extensive fur trade from pre-1890 to 1927 (Lunney <em>et al.</em> 1997). The species was also hunted extensively in the Grampians area of Victoria. The magnitude of hunting is apparent when one considers that the current population of the species is estimated at between 15,000 and 30,000 individuals, and in 1908 alone 92,590 skins were marketed by a single company (Lunney <em>et al.</em> 1997).","<p>In 2008, the population size was estimated to be between 15 000 and 30 000 individuals (DECC 2008), with most (80%) in north-eastern New South Wales, and far smaller proportions in central and south-eastern New South Wales (2%), south-eastern Queensland (17%) and Victoria (&lt;1%) (DECC 2008).<br/><br/>The population is declining, however the rate of decline is poorly resolved: Taggart <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered that the decline was ‘significant’ but &lt;30% over a 10-year period. Decline (and extirpation) is probably now inexorable at many to most of the smaller colonies unless these are intensively managed (by threat reduction and manipulation of genetic stocks). Mahon <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported on trends in 12 colonies in the Hunter-Central Rivers region of New South Wales from 2003 to 2011, with six of the colonies subject to intensive fox control, three colonies as unmanaged controls, and three colonies in more productive habitat and subject to wild dog control. There was no difference in population trends between treatments and a fitted regression model predicted decline in an abundance index (rock-wallaby pellets) of 58% over 10 years.<br/><br/>There have been many intensive monitoring programs for individual colonies (or groups of colonies) of Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies, and more broadly-based ongoing assessments of the persistence of larger groups of colonies (Dovey <em>et al</em>. 1997; DECC 2008). Eldridge <em>et al</em>. (2004) described the decline of a colony at Jenolan Caves from about 90 individuals in 1985 to seven individuals in 1992, probably due to predation. Monitoring at the two regional populations of Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies in Victoria demonstrated incremental loss of subpopulations and total population size, culminating in the extirpation of the Grampians population in 1999 (with subsequent trial reintroduction in 2008: Molyneux <em>et al</em>. 2011), and the persistence of only one subpopulation in eastern Victoria at Little River Gorge (Bluff <em>et al</em>. 2011)</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby has a disjunct range in south-eastern Australia, mostly associated with the Great Dividing Range, from the Grampians in western Victoria to south-eastern Queensland (Yarramam, north of Toowoomba). The isolated Grampians subpopulation was extirpated in about 1999 (Corrigan <em>et al</em>. 2012), but is the subject of a current reintroduction program using animals from East Gippsland and hybrids between the two ESUs (Corrigan <em>et al</em>. 2012; Malam <em>et al</em>. 2012; P. Menkhorst <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Historically, the Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby has been reported at nearly 1000 sites (DECC 2008): of these, 77% were still occupied in 2004, 15% were unoccupied and persistence at the remainder was uncertain (DECC 2008). Many (‘dozens of’) subpopulations (including at Taralga and several sites in the Warrambungles) have been extirpated since 2004 (M. Eldridge <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The species' &#160;distribution has declined considerably since European settlement, with losses particularly from isolated subpopulations in inland and southern New South Wales (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011), and from Victoria (Menkhorst 1995). It has not been recorded in the Australian Capital Territory since 1959 (ACT Government 1999).<br/><br/>There is an extralimital population in Hawaii (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011) and formerly another in New Zealand (now exterminated: M.

This hunting pressure may have been a primary factor in the historical decline (Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2008) and thence to the species’ vulnerability to other threats. At least 500 000 individuals were killed between 1894 and 1914, and almost 100,000 skins were marketed by a single company in one year (1908) (Lunney <em>et al</em>. 1997).

Roache (2011) provides a series of costed management and research actions aimed at recovering the species to Least Concern status. <br/><br/>There has been a substantial management effort devoted to the conservation of this species (Menkhorst and Hynes 2011). This includes the establishment of several captive breeding populations; survey and monitoring; research into ecology, genetics and threats; habitat protection; re-introductions; supplementation of small colonies for genetic or demographic concerns; and intensive management of some threats at some colonies. Management has achieved some local success (increased population size or stabilization of some populations), however the overall population trend remains declining.<br/><br/>The recovery of this species is particularly complex and requires a consideration of threats and management interventions at a variety of spatial scales, from local to regional (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2008; DECC 2008).

Beneath these shrubs, it forms runways. Several individuals may be found sheltering in one patch of shrubs, although adults of each sex appear to live in well-defined individual home ranges or territories. Feeding takes place at night in open areas. Grasses usually make up less than half the dietary intake with the remainder being composed of malvaceous and leguminous shrubs and other dicotyledons (Richards <em>et al</em>. 2001; Prince and Richards 2008). </p>","The current major threats to the subpopulations of the species include: the introduction of predators (feral cats and Red Foxes, dogs) to islands, destructive wildfire, and disease (Richards 2007). Introduced black rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than the larger predators. Extreme fluctuations in populations on islands are a threat, but this threat is seen as minor relative to the risk exotic predators being introduced (Short <em>et al.</em> 1997). As extreme weather events become more common, and given that all locations for the species are nearby islands in Shark Bay, these fluctuations are a cause for concern as the area is predicted to continue to suffer reduced annual rainfall. The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination of&#160;predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance.","Abundance on Bernier and Dorre Islands fluctuates greatly with rainfall.

The number of locations is unknown but probably not substantially more than 10. The population size is &gt;10,000 mature individuals. There is no reliable assessment of trends in population size, but limited information provides weak (and inconsistent) inference of continuing population decline. Declines over last, or next three generation period are unlikely to approach 30%, so are insufficient to qualify for criterion A.</p>","<p>Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroo is restricted mostly to rainforest habitats, but also extends along riparian vegetation through primarily open forest habitats, and less abundantly in wet sclerophyll forests along the western edge of the Atherton Tablelands (Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001a). <br/><br/>Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroo is mainly nocturnal, but also intermittently active during daylight hours.&#160; Its diet mostly comprises foliage from a broad range of tree species and some vines, although Newell (1999a) noted that individual tree-kangaroos each used only a small set of plant species. It is predominantly arboreal.<br/><br/>&#160;Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroos occupy some rainforest fragments (even fragments &lt;20 ha) (Laurance 1990, 1991, 1995, 1997; Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2008), although populations in such fragments may have limited long-term viability. Individuals can disperse through unsuitable habitat, but at such times may be particularly susceptible to predation by dogs, and to being killed by vehicles (Kanowski and Tucker 2002).<br/><br/>Climate change and associated factors have been predicted to have a major detrimental impact on this species, acting directly or indirectly through reduction in rainforest area, reduction in foliar nitrogen concentration, habitat degradation due to increased incidence of severe cyclones, increased incidence of high temperatures, and reduced incidence of free water in mist (Kanowski 2001, 2004; Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001; Winter 2004). Williams <em>et al</em>. (2003) predicted that increasing temperatures will result in the significant reduction of the core environment for this species.<br/><br/>&#160;Lumholtz’s Tree-kangaroos are mostly solitary within loose social groups, typically with one male and several females. In high quality habitat (fertile recent basalt-derived soils), males occupy home ranges of about 2 ha, which may encompass the non-overlapping and smaller (1-2 ha) ranges of several females (Newell 1999a; Johnson and Newell 2008). Site fidelity is very strong, with individuals reported to stay in their home range even if clearing or disturbance renders it unsuitable (Newell 1999bc).<br/><br/>Breeding is broadly seasonal, with females producing a single young, mostly during the wet season. Age to maturity is two years for females and 4.6 years for males (Johnson and Newell 2008).</p>","Historically, the main threat has been reduction of habitat, but this has ceased with the declaration of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, and the species appears to have been able to persist in the mosaic of fragmented habitat (particularly where there are available habitat corridors). On the Atherton Tableland, increased fragmentation makes them more vulnerable to predation by dogs, although strategic reforestation on the Atherton Tableland opens the possibility of some recovery of its original area of occupancy in the future (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). In agricultural areas where it occurs, predation by dogs and road kills represent threats. Climate change and associated factors have been predicted to have a major detrimental impact on this species, acting directly or indirectly through reduction in rainforest area, reduction in foliar nitrogen concentration, habitat degradation due to increased incidence of severe cyclones, increased incidence of high temperatures, and reduced incidence of free water in mist (Kanowski 2001, 2004; Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001; Winter 2004).","<p>Kanowski <em>et al</em>. (2001a) estimated that the 650 km<sup>2</sup> of high altitude rainforest (&gt;800 m a.s.l.) in the Wet Tropics World Heritage area supported 10,000 to 20,000 individuals, and this would represent the majority of the population.<br/><br/>Johnson and Newell (2008) considered it ‘sparse’. Winter <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported that it ‘is common in suitable habitat’. Densities are higher at elevations above 700 to 800 m. a.s.l. (Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001a, 2003). A maximum density of 1 individual/ha was reported across a set of 40 sampled rainforest sites in the Atherton Tablelands area, with mean abundance of&#160; 0.4 individuals per hectare (Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001b). Density is greater in forests on nutrient-rich basalt soils than on nutrient-poor acid igneous and metamorphic soils (Newell 1999c; Kanowski <em>et al</em>. 2001ab, 2003). In one rainforest regrowth fragment, on highly fertile basalt soils, Newell (1999a) reported densities of 1.4-1.5 individuals per hectare.<br/><br/>Winter <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported that its population size was stable. However, Laurance <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported a highly significant decline (of about 60%) in abundance in four intact rainforest sites sampled in 1986-87 and again in 2006-07, although this change may have been due to disturbance-related changes in forest structure and hence detectability (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2008; R. Martin <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Kanowski <em>et al</em>. (2008) sampled nine intact forest sites in 1995-97 and again in 2006, six to eight months after Cyclone Larry had damaged vegetation at these sites, and reported a weakly significant trend for decrease in abundance across this sampling period, albeit with interpretation compromised by a small number of records for this species. However, abundance estimates based on spotlighting have some constraints due to low detectability (Newell 1999a; Martin 2005; R.

(Gilbert’s ‘forests’ would today be termed woodlands.) John Gilbert reported to Gould (1863) that ‘it makes no nest, but forms a hollow in the soft ground beneath a thick brush in which it lies during the heat of the day’.

As a result it is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic effects, such that it could become Critically Endangered or even Extinct within a short time period. However, over the last 10 years there have been no declines in abundance or occupancy of sufficient magnitude to justify listing as Endangered.","In the past, this species inhabited a wide range of vegetation types, generally characterized as dry woodlands, thickets and grassland. In its current limited distribution it shows a preference for transitional vegetation between dense <em>Acacia</em> scrub and eucalyptus open woodlands with grassy understory, and between pasture and young regrowth of Brigalow <em>Acacia harpophylla </em>(Evans 1992). It forages solitarily, mostly under tree cover, unless its food is scarce in dry times when it ventures further into open areas (Fisher 2000). It feeds at night, and shelters during the day in scrapes in dense thickets or in hollow logs (Fisher 2000). Young that have left the pouch but are still suckling remain hidden under low shrubs, in dense grass or in logs for most of the day and night. Dense ground cover is therefore essential for survival of juveniles (Fisher and Goldizen 2001).<br/><br/>Bridled Nailtail Wallabies feed on a high diversity of plants (&gt; 60 species) and show strong selection for plant species and plant parts of high nutritional quality and low fibre content. They feed on forbs, grasses and browse, in proportions that vary according to availability in different seasons. Forbs are generally selected for, and grasses selected against, especially during dry seasons when the diet also includes woody browse species (Evans and Jarman 1998).They can breed at any time of year, and in good conditions females may raise up to three young in a year (Lundie-Jenkins and Lowry 2005).","The species is threatened by introduced predators, the Red Fox and feral Cat especially; Dingoes or wild Dogs may also threaten small surviving population in unfenced sites. The impact of foxes is attested by the fact that the last surviving wild population (at Taunton) occupied a site at which foxes were absent. Populations introduced into a large fenced reserve at Scotia from which foxes and cats are excluded increased rapidly to high numbers, but subpopulations released outside those fences collapsed in the presence of low densities of foxes (S. Legge pers. comm. 2014). Modelling of the Taunton population demonstrated that predation of juveniles by feral Cats was sufficient to cause decline (Fisher <em>et al. </em>2000). Wild Dogs also appear to be a significant cause of mortality in that population&#160;(J. Augusteyn&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014). Other threats include destruction of habitat, which probably contributed to historical declines, and degradation of habitat through invasion of introduced plants, especially Buffel Grass <em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em>. Drought is a cause of stochastic variation in population size, which could be critical for the three populations that have populations numbering in the hundreds or less.","Although the Bridled Nailtail Wallaby was reported to be a common animal at the time of European settlement (Lundie-Jenkins and Lowry 2005), its decline was rapid. The current total population size at unfenced sites is small. Recent (2011-2012) estimates of population size based on mark-recapture and transect counting are&#160;approximately&#160;90-130 individuals at Taunton and 100 individuals at Idalia (J. Augusteyn pers. comm. 2014; A. Horsup&#160;pers. comm.<em> </em>2014, D. Fisher&#160;pers. comm. 2014). Estimates using similar methods&#160;at Avocet&#160;were 30-40 in 2008 (Kinglsey <em>et al.</em> 2012) and 66 in 2012 (A. Horsup&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014, D. Fisher&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014).&#160;The area of occupancy at Taunton has declined considerably, from approximately 25 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the late 1908s to 4 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;currently (Wang and Fisher 2012). In 1985 the population at Taunton was estimated to be approximately 500 (Tierney 1985), and in 1991 was thought to be approximately 1400&#160;(Davidson 1991) though this might have been an overestimate (D. Fisher&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014). The size of the Idalia population has fluctuated considerably. It was established in 1993 from a release of 275 individuals (Lundie-Jenkins and Lowry 2005), increased to approximately 400 individuals by 1999 (Pople <em>et al. </em>2001), then declined as a result of drought in 2002. In 2008 and 2011 the known minimum population size was 123 and 96 respectively (J. Augusteyn&#160;<em>pers. comm.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>The population in the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Scotia Sanctuary, where a fence excludes non-native predators, is the largest, consisting of approximately 2000 free-ranging animals, with a further 1500 in a captive breeding program (S. Legge pers. comm. 2014). The free-ranging animals are included in the overall population estimate as they are considered to be a viable and self-sustaining population established for more than five years. The Scotia population was established from 12 animals translocated in 1998, followed by further releases of 162 individuals in 2004-05.",Stable,"The Bridled Nailtail Wallaby was formerly spread over a large area that extended through inland regions of eastern Australia from south western South Australia to as far north as the base of Cape York Peninsula.

Fire management – Annual burns are undertaken to reduce fuel loads and promote plant diversity. Supplementary feed and water provisioning – Feed and water stations are now being used by wombats, particularly in dry times (Treby <em>et al.</em> 2007). Permanent management presence on Epping Forest National Park – A volunteer caretaker program ensures twice daily monitoring of the dingo fence.<br/><br/>2) Accurately monitoring wombats.

Many subpopulations are now isolated and may be non-viable. It faces a wide range of threats. There is limited information on population trends (particularly for the largest subpopulations, in the Nullarbor area), but estimates for some subpopulations (e.g. of 70% decline in the Murray Lands, South Australia from 2002 to 2008: Taggart and Robinson 2008) suggest that it may approach an overall population decline threshold of 30% over three generations (27-36 years), currently and in the future. Hence it is listed as Near Threatened as it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A2b.","It is found in semi-arid areas of grassland, open plains, shrublands, savanna, and open woodland. Animals live in colonies within extensive burrow systems. Each warren contains several animals (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). The species is long-lived (reaching more than 15 years in the wild) (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008), and has a low rate of recruitment. Females are thought to be monogamous, and they produce a single young that lives in the pouch for six to seven months and is weaned after about a year (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). However, in drought years reproduction may cease and three consecutive years of ample rainfall are needed for there to be an increase in a population (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). Animals become sexually mature at about 3 years of age (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008).","Presumably the range of the Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat declined through conversion of suitable habitat to agricultural land (in the past, for part of its range, though much of the current range is in pastoral lands). It is threatened by competition for grazing by domestic stock and introduced rabbits (Taggart and Temple-Smith 2008). Sarcoptic mange is now a major threat in the Murray Lands to the east; it kills 80-90 percent of affected populations/groups (Ruykys <em>et al</em>. 2009; Death <em>et al</em>. 2011). Wells (1995) noted that the seasonal pattern of productivity of annual and non-native plants does not coincide with the weaning period of wombat young, leading to high infant mortality. Drought is another threat, especially for successful reproduction (the species needs a minimum of three years without drought to increase in number and reproduction ceases during drought years). In parts of the range, it is considered as a pest and management attempts to reduce population size (Sparrow 2009).","<p>Taggart and Robinson (2008) provided the most comprehensive assessments of population size, noting estimates of 50,000 to 100,000 individuals in the South Australia portion of the Nullarbor Plain; no population estimates for the small Western Australia portion of the Nullarbor Plain; 10,000 - 15,000 individuals in the Murray Lands (with the population size in that area having declined by about 70% since 2002, probably due to drought and sarcoptic mange); and far smaller subpopulations scattered across the Yorke (including about 200 individuals at Urania) and Eyre Peninsulas (including about 100 individuals at Wool Bay, about 400 individuals at Port Victoria, about 50 - 100 on Kadina, about 3,000 individuals at Elliston, and about 100 at Small Kellidie); 100 - 1,000 around Lake Everard; and about 10,000 in the Gawler Ranges (but this estimate is about 25 years old). A more recent comprehensive survey of the Yorke Peninsula reported 2523 active wombat burrows, and used a conversion factor (0.43 wombats per active burrow) to estimate a total population on Yorke Peninsula of 696 wombats, spread over 25 colonies, with only three of those colonies having &gt;100 individuals (Urania with 272, Kulpara 146 and Point Pearce with 135 individuals), and 19 colonies having &lt;10 individuals (Sparrow 2009).<br/><br/>&#160;In parts of its range (e.g. Murray Lands), the Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat is considered ‘over-abundant’ and in significant conflict with farming communities (O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2012); in other parts (e.g. Yorke Peninsula), subpopulations are small, few and scattered. In New South Wales it is known from two localities each with between 2 and 10 individuals (NSW Scientific Committee 1997). Sparrow (2009) noted that only the Nullarbor subpopulations were ‘secure’, with all other subpopulations ‘vulnerable’ other than the Yorke Peninsula subpopulations which were ‘endangered’.<br/><br/>Hogan <em>et al</em>.

They feed primarily on nectar and pollen, gliding at night between feed trees and sometimes foraging close to the ground. They usually forage alone, possibly to avoid predators (Van Dyck 1993; Jackson 1998). They use tree hollows as dens for sleeping and rearing young (Jackson 2000a). First breeding occurs at around 12 - 18 months and young are weaned after 4 - 5 months (Jackson 2000b).","Clearing of forest for sugar cane, bananas, pineapples, improved pasture, Caribbean pine, and aquaculture has had a dramatic impact on habitat and has lead to a corresponding reduction in the distribution and connectivity of the species. Only 20 percent of former available habitat remains (Blackman <em>et al.</em> 1994) and this is severely fragmented (Parsons and Latch 2007). Altered fire regimes, weed invasion, and intensive grazing threaten the structure and ecological integrity of remaining habitat fragments. The subsequent decline in habitat quality and isolation of populations are major threats to the species’ survival. Major roads disrupt movements of Mahogany Gliders and road kills have been recorded. Mahogany Gliders also can become entangled on barbed-wire fences resulting in fatalities (P. Latch pers. comm.).","The Mahogany Glider is cryptic, elusive, and virtually silent.

21959641,16730,Petaurus australis,Near Threatened,,2016,2014-03-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Near Threatened because the few ongoing monitoring programs demonstrate decline in population size and/or area of occupancy that may approach 30% over a three generation period, because it is likely to face ongoing decline because of legacy impacts of habitat fragmentation, recent increases in land clearing in the Queensland parts of the distribution, and because habitat quality continues to be affected by inappropriate fire regimes and/or logging. For these reasons the species may be close to meeting the requirements for listing as Vulnerable under criteria A2bc+3bc+4bc.","<p>The Yellow-bellied Glider occurs in eucalypt-dominated forests and woodlands. Habitat suitability is determined in part by floristics, with a clear preference for forest types dominated by gum-barked and winter-flowering eucalypts (Kavanagh 1987; Eyre and Smith 1997; Eyre 2004), and with forest age sufficient to provide suitable trees for shelter and foraging (Milledge <em>et al</em>. 1991; Incoll <em>et al</em>. 2001; Eyre and Goldingay 2003). The Yellow-bellied Glider is reliant on large areas of mature forest (Milledge <em>et al</em>. 1991; Eyre and Smith 1997; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1999a; Incoll <em>et al</em>. 2001; Eyre 2002, 2004; van der Ree <em>et al. </em>2004).<br/><br/>The Yellow-bellied Glider is social, with pairs or larger family groups (of varying age and sex composition) occupying an exclusive large home range (30-65 ha: Henry and Craig 1984; Craig 1985; Goldingay 1992; Goldingay and Kavanagh 1993). Consequently it needs large forest blocks in order to maintain population viability. Home range sizes need to be large because foraging substrates are widely dispersed and are variable through space and time (Goldingay 2000). Microhabitat preferences of Yellow-bellied Gliders may change seasonally according to patterns of flowering, bark-shed and availability of other food resources (Kavanagh 1984). In south-eastern Queensland, Eyre (2002) considered that forest fragments needed to be at least 320 km<sup>2</sup> in order to be occupied by Yellow-bellied Gliders; and more generally Goldingay and Possingham (1995) considered that forest areas needed to be 180-350 km<sup>2</sup> to retain viable populations. It does not persist in smaller fragments now isolated by clearing or pine plantations (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1999b).<br/><br/>The impacts of fragmentation are particularly pronounced because of this species’ apparent incapacity to traverse extensive tracts (i.e. longer than gliding distance) of cleared land. The Yellow-bellied Glider can forage in tall regrowth (Kavanagh 2004) and may tolerate moderate levels of logging disturbance, provided old trees are retained within riparian zones and key sap tree species are retained (Goldingay and Kavanagh 1993; Kavanagh 2004), although such tolerance may be somewhat site-specific and vary with landscape context and subsequent management (Milledge <em>et al</em>. 1991; Eyre and Smith 1997; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1999). Extensive disturbance by logging or wildfire is detrimental (Lunney 1987)<em>.</em> Logging tends to reduce the proportion of large stems in a forest stand which reduces the availability of hollow-bearing trees (and den sites) and foraging substrate and food resources, including nectar, sap and invertebrates (Eyre and Smith 1997; Eyre 2002, 2004). Yellow-bellied Gliders are eliminated from clear-felled and intensively logged forests (Smith et al. 1994). Subpopulations of Yellow-bellied Gliders have declined or been extirpated from sites exposed to high intensity wildfire.<br/><br/>Females typically give birth to a single young annually (Goldingay 2008).</p>","Habitat loss and fragmentation due to timber-harvesting and agriculture are the main threats to this species. Due to past forest management there is a current dearth of available live hollow-bearing trees within Yellow-Bellied Glider habitats. Remaining hollow-bearing trees are therefore an important resource, but these are at risk of collapse due to regular prescribed burning regimes and windthrow. In Queensland and New South Wales (and possibly Victoria) broad-scale land clearing had been stopped due to newly introduced vegetation management legislation However, in Queensland relaxation of this legislation during the last three years has resulted in a sharp increase in forest clearing since 2013 (see <a href=""http://heconversation.com/land-clearing-in-queensland-triples-after-policy-ping-pong-38279"">https://theconversation.com/land-clearing-in-queensland-triples-after-policy-ping-pong-38279</a>). The effects of this recent change on Queensland populations of the Yellow-bellied Glider have not yet been specifically evaluated, but they are potentially significant. Furthermore, degradation to existing habitat (e.g., through fire, timber removal) within the habitat of isolated populations, but also between non-isolated populations, is a major threat to the species (essentially inducing a fragmentation effect) throughout its range, due to its wide-ranging and extensive habitat requirements (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).","There is no reliable estimate of population size. Maxwell <em>et al</em>. (1996) considered it ‘uncommon throughout range’. Carthew (2004) estimated that there were (then) only six individuals present in South Australia, in a single 200 ha forest patch.

It has a limited distribution and exists as a series of small, severely fragmented subpopulations. Significant declines in population size have occurred during the past decade in all forest types inhabited by the Leadbeater’s Possum. Of the available high quality habitat, 40-45% was burnt in the 2009 Black Saturday fires (D. Lindenmayer, D. Harley <em>pers. comm</em>. in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014). Post-fire monitoring has shown that it is now absent from sites burnt in 2009, irrespective of burn severity, indicating that the population size has declined by &gt;40% since 2009. Monitoring of known subpopulations and modelling indicates that the current rate of decline is &gt;50% and suspected to be &gt;80% over the last 18 years (= three generations), with this rate likely to increase over the next 18 years. This species is therefore listed as Critically Endangered.</p>","<p>Leadbeater's Possum is a nocturnal, arboreal species that spends its day in tree hollows. Its diet mainly consists of exudates from trees and to a lesser extent arthropods (Smith 1984).<br/><br/>Optimum habitat for Leadbeater's Possum is a regenerating or uneven-aged Ash forest with a dense understorey of Acacia trees and an ample supply of old hollow trees. The species’ occurrence and population size is strongly linked to nest hollow availability (e.g. Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2013).<br/><br/>Leadbeater’s Possums do not occur on burned sites until required conditions have returned (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>.&#160;pers. comm., 2014a in Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2015).<br/><br/>The occurrence and quality of habitat is primarily determined by patterns of successional change and stand development resulting from disturbance, such as past wildfires and timber harvesting operations. Regrowth from the 1939 wildfires, combined with fire-killed remnants of mature forest, has provided abundant feeding and nesting habitat during the last 30 years.<br/><br/>Older aged and mixed aged forest containing live hollow-bearing trees also support populations of Leadbeater's Possum, although not in the same high densities that can be found in suitable regrowth forests. The role, however, of these suboptimal forests in the medium-term will be critical for conservation of the species. These forests are not subject to a rapid decline in habitat suitability that is predicted to occur in current high value habitat regrowth forests. Older aged forest and mixed aged forest with hollow-bearing trees and a low occurrence of wattles are defined as potentially optimum habitat because of their potential to become optimum in the short term (&lt;30 years), as a result of natural or deliberate disturbance. <br/><br/>In surveys to identify current strongholds after the 2009 fires, sites most likely to be occupied by Leadbeater’s Possum were generally characterised by lush, unburnt vegetation in gullies in areas that had relatively low summer temperatures and high summer rainfall (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>","This species is heavily dependent on old trees, and fire-killed remnants that are rapidly decaying and falling over. Recruitment of suitable hollows, used for shelter and breeding, is very slow. The long-term viability of habitat in mature and mixed aged forests is threatened by wildfires and some timber harvesting practices. The species and its remnant habitat also are closely tied to a narrow set of climatic conditions that could be severely affected by global warming (Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 1991).","<p>During the past decade, and especially because of wildfire in 2009, severe declines have occurred in all forest types that the possum inhabits. <br/><br/>The discrete subpopulation in the small Yellingbo area was estimated to contain 60 individuals in 2012 (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2015). The total population size across the main range of Leadbeater’s Possum is less well resolved. Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2015) noted a range of estimates from 2000 to 11,250, and concluded that the number of mature breeding individuals was less than 10,000 and very likely to be less than 2500.&#160;The 2009 Black Saturday fire burnt 45% of high quality Leadbeater’s Possum habitat (D. Harley pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)). Post-fire surveys indicate that the species is absent from burnt sites, regardless of burn severity (D. Lindenmayer pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014); P. Menkhorst pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al.</em> (2014)). Thus, the population size is likely to have been reduced by at least 45% since 2009. The severe impacts of the 2009 fire are highlighted by results from Lake Mountain, where a major subpopulation stronghold containing 200-300 individuals was reduced to just six individuals (i.e. &gt;95% mortality) (D. Harley pers. comm.). The 2009 fires also reduced the availability of suitable tree hollows, particularly dead standing trees preferred by Leadbeater’s Possum.<br/><br/>Even prior to the 2009 fires, modelling predicted that subpopulations in montane ash forest would decline by about 90% over the 30 year period from 2008 due to loss of suitable den trees (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1990, 1997, 2012; Smith and Lindenmayer 1992; Menkhorst 2008).<br/><br/>Monitoring indicates that the Yellingbo subpopulation declined from 122 individuals in 2003 (D. Harley <em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)) to just 60 individuals in 2012, representing a 46% decline over nine years (D. Harley pers. comm.<em>&#160;</em>in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)). There has been a 30% reduction in the occupied area of the reserve over this period, and it is estimated that less than 20 ha of high quality habitat is currently available (D. Harley pers. comm.&#160;in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. (2014)). Further declines are anticipated due to ongoing deterioration in habitat condition. Fire poses a major risk to this small, localized subpopulation.</p>",Decreasing,"Leadbeater’s Possum&#160;is endemic to Australia, where it is restricted to central Victoria. Most of its limited range is in the forests of the central highlands, bounded by Toolangi (in the west), Beenak (in the south), Mt Baw Baw (in the east) and Rubicon (in the north), in an elevational range from about 500 to 1,500 m a.s.l.

Research in the central highlands suggests that nest boxes receive a low rate of occupancy and would be ineffective as a large-scale solution to the problem (Lindenmayer <em>et al.</em> 2003).

It has been successfully introduced (assisted colonisation) to Bald Island Nature Reserve (8 km<sup>2</sup>) and is being reintroduced to a 3.8 km<sup>2</sup> mainland island at Waychinicup National Park. The main factors that are the cause of the species being eligible for listing in the Critically Endangered category are its small population size and its precarious geographic distribution.&#160;In 2012 there was estimated to be 100 individuals (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014) but it has approximately halved in 2015, mostly due to fires.","<p>Gilbert’s Potoroos inhabit dense, long-unburnt heathland. At Two Peoples Bay, the heaths they inhabit are about 1.5-2.5 m high and are dominated by <em>Melaleuca striata</em> and <em>M. thymoides</em> with a dense layer of sedges underneath. The area has not been burnt for more than 50 years (Courtenay and Friend 2004). In the past, local colonies were probably wiped out by fire, as the general area is fire prone, but would have moved back into regenerating vegetation from nearby colonies (Friend 2009).</p>    <p>The diet consists almost entirely of fungi. A study of dietary composition based on faecal analysis (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004) found that fungal material made up more than 90% of the scat contents, the remainder comprising sand and root material that had apparently been ingested incidentally, as well as invertebrates and occasionally seeds from fleshy fruits. While 44 species of fungi were consumed in total, five species were found to be consumed by over 60% of animals in all seasons of the year. Gilbert’s Potoroo is one of the most fungi dependent mammals in the world.</p>  <br/>Trapping and radio-tracking has shown that Gilbert’s Potoroos live in small groups in the patchy habitat. These colonies are isolated from each other but dispersing sub-adult animals and some older males move between them. Amongst resident animals there is little overlap in home range between animals of the same sex, but there is strong overlap between males and females (Courtenay and Friend 2004).","Predation by introduced red foxes and feral cats are the major threats. Fire is also a major threat at Two Peoples Bay as the subpopulation there is highly restricted and dependent on old vegetation. A large fire would eliminate most habitat and exacerbate predation by feral cats and red foxes. Bald Island is thought not to have burnt for hundreds of years.&#160;<br/>In November 2015 a bushfire burnt through the Mt Gardner headland of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, near Albany, Western Australia and severely impacted the habitat of the original wild population of Gilbert’s Potoroo. In January 2016 this species was identified as one of the 20 mammals within the Australian Government’s Threatened Species Strategy for priority conservation. This conservation advice has been updated in consultation with the Western Australia government to reflect the current status of this species and any proposed changes to conservation actions (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Gilbert’s Potoroo was rediscovered on Mount Gardner within Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve in 1994 after the implementation of a fox baiting program. Currently, there are an estimated 30-40 individuals in the Mount Gardner subpopulation and this appears to be the maximum that can be supported by the available habitat (Friend 2008b, 2009). Ten Gilbert’s Potoroos were translocated from the wild population on Mount Gardner to Bald Island in six separate releases between 2005–2007 (Friend 2009, Finlayson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent estimates suggest a current (2012) population on Bald Island of around 60 (T. Friend <em>pers</em>.<em> comm</em>.). In 2009, six Bald Island animals were removed in the first of a series of transfers, along with captive animals, to start a new semi-captive population in a 380 ha fenced area in Waychinicup National Park, in 2012 comprising more than 20 animals. In late 2007 (five years prior to this evaluation) there were c. 40-45 mature individuals, and the number may have exceeded 50 mature individuals of Gilbert’s Potoroo by the end of 2009 (T. Friend <em>pers</em>.<em> comm</em>.). However, recent data (2014) suggest that the species has declined at some sites.",Decreasing,"Gilbert’s Potoroos probably never had a large geographic range, as subfossil and modern data reveal a past distribution near the south coast of Western Australia from near Margaret River to near Albany. Three early collectors found it in the vicinity of King George Sound (Albany) between 1840 and 1879, but exact locations are unknown. John Gilbert, who collected specimens for John Gould, reported that he had not heard of it being found anywhere else but King George Sound (Gould 1863). Gilbert’s Potoroo was, for a long time, thought to be extinct, despite targeted searches (Kabay and Start 1976), until it was rediscovered on Mount Gardner, Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, in 1994 (Sinclair <em>et al</em>. 1996). In November 2015 wildfire caused the near loss of this population.&#160;It has been successfully introduced (assisted colonisation) in 2005-2007 to Bald Island Nature Reserve (8 km<sup>2</sup>). &#160;This population was estimated to exceed 65 individuals in 2012 but is currently estimated to be around 40 individuals (DPaW pers comm. 2016),&#160;and has been reintroduced, in 2009, to a fenced mainland island at Waychinicup National Park (Bougher and Friend 2009). Despite regular supplements from Bald Island, this population has failed to thrive, and now comprises less than 20 individuals.&#160;A captive colony was maintained for 15 years but captive breeding was not successful with no offspring provided for translocations and all remaining captive animals were released into the Waychinicup fenced enclosure in 2010 (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).",,Terrestrial,"<p>Recovery is guided by the Gilbert’s Potoroo Recovery Plan (Courtenay and Friend 2004), which superseded an interim recovery plan prepared within a few weeks of the species' rediscovery (Start and Burbidge 1995).

Cross fostering was carried out over on an experimental basis with limited success (Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2010). Considerable research has been conducted into the biology, ecology and reproduction of Gilbert’s Potoroo and is ongoing. Extensive searches using hair-trapping have been carried out in suitable habitat along the coast from Two Peoples Bay to Northcliffe and in the Margaret River area. Less targeted surveys have been carried out to the east of Albany, especially in the Fitzgerald River National Park, but no new populations have been discovered. The majority of ongoing funding has been provided by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation and the Australian Government through the Natural Heritage Trust, with contributions from the Gilbert’s Potoroo Action Group, WWF-Australia Threatened Species Network, and the Foundation for Australia’s Most Endangered Species Ltd (FAME).<br/>  <p>Following rediscovery of Gilbert’s Potoroo, there was extensive research into the species’ biology and ecology (e.g. Sinclair <em>et al</em>. 1996, 2000, 2002; Sinclair and Westerman 1997; Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004; Cochrane <em>et al</em>. 2005; Vaughan <em>et al</em>. 2007; Austin <em>et al</em>. 2009; Friend 2009; Bougher and Friend 2009; Lee <em>et al</em>. 2009; Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2010; Stead-Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2010) and a captive breeding facility was constructed in the hope that captive-bred potoroos could be reintroduced to other conservation reserves. Captive breeding, however, has proved to be difficult (Friend 2009), even with cross-fostering (Taggart <em>et al</em>. 2010), and the decision was taken to introduce wild potoroos from Two Peoples Bay to Bald Island Nature Reserve, the only island in the region that had suitable habitat. Monitoring of the Bald Island subpopulation shows that it has expanded to occupy most available habitat.</p>  The Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife manages Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, Bald Island Nature Reserve and Waychinicup National Park. Management of Two Peoples Bay is conducted in accordance with a management plan (Orr <em>et al</em>. 1995, amended in 2004). Management includes aerial and ground baiting to control the Red Fox, trapping to control feral Cats, fire management including exclusion of prescribed fire from Mt Gardner (which also protects threatened bird taxa including the Noisy Scrub-bird <em>Atrichornis clamosus</em>), and monitoring of Gilbert’s Potoroo and other threatened species. In 2009, a 380 ha area within Waychinicup National Park was fenced to exclude foxes and feral Cats. Potoroos were transferred to this mainland island from Bald Island and Mount Gardner between 2010 and 2012 (Friend <em>et al</em>. 2012).

It does not meet the criteria for a classification of Vulnerable, but its extent of occurrence is close to the threshold at which it would be considered Vulnerable under criterion B1 if there was also evidence for continuing decline in occurrence, occupancy, habitat quality or abundance. It is therefore possible that increases in predation or declines in habitat quality in the near future could move the species into the Vulnerable category. These changes are possible, given that (i) the feral Cat is widespread in the habitat of the Eastern Bettong, and studies on a closely related species, the Woylie (Marlow <em>et al. </em>2015) show that increases in the cat population could have major impacts, and (ii) intensification of agriculture in parts of eastern Tasmania could result in increased fragmentation and declines in quality of habitat. Similarly, if the Red Fox were to become established in Tasmania this could be expected to have a major impact on the Eastern Bettong, given the evidence that Red Fox predation caused the extinction of the Eastern Bettong from mainland Australia (Short 1998; Johnson 2006).&#160;</p>","<p>Mainland animals apparently inhabited open forest with a grassy understorey (Seebeck 1995). In Tasmania, the species occurs in eucalypt and casuarina forests and woodlands with grassy or heath ground cover. During the daytime the animals take refuge in nests built under a fallen limb or among short bushes or tussocks, and sited in a shallow depression dug by the animal. The nests are spherical structures with a side entrance. They are well camouflaged and constructed using nesting material collected by the animal, and transported in bundles held in the prehensile tail. The outer wall of the nest is built with coarse grass and twigs, and the resting chamber is given an inner lining of softer grasses or fibres stripped from the bark of stringybark trees. The diet is mainly hypogeal fungi but also includes seeds, tubers and bulbs (Johnson 1994). Home range is 65-135 ha and an individual can travel up to 1.5 km between its nest and feeding areas (Rose and Rose 1998; Rose and Johnson 2008).<br/><br/>The eastern bettong provides important ecosystem services. Like other bettongs, and potoroos, it digs for its food, creating many small foraging pits (Fleming et al 2014). These create microtopographic variation that promotes regeneration of some plants, and digging contributes to loosening and turnover of soil, which improves soil condition and water infiltration and promotes the breakdown of organic matter. Most of the fungi eaten by the Eastern Bettong are mycorrhiza-forming species. As a result of feeding on their fruiting bodies, the Eastern Bettong disperses the spores of these fungi in its faeces. This is probably a crucial factor in the maintenance of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the dry forests inhabited by the Eastern Bettong. This in turn helps maintain the productivity and diversity of plant communities (Johnson 1996).<br/><br/>The Eastern Bettong breeds throughout the year. Individuals reach sexual maturity within their first year, and females can produce up to three young per year.</p>","The Eastern Bettong is potentially threatened by predation from the Red Fox&#160;(<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) and feral Cat (<em>Felis catus</em>). Historically, the Red Fox has not occurred in Tasmania, but if it&#160;were to become established in Tasmania this could be expected to have a major impact on the Eastern Bettong, given the evidence that predation by the Red Fox caused the species' extinction from mainland Australia (Short 1998; Johnson 2006). There is evidence of a recent incursion of the Red Fox, possibly as a result of a deliberate introduction (Sarre <em>et al.</em> 2013). This triggered an eradication program (<a href=""http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program"">http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program</a>). There have been no definite records of foxes in Tasmania since 2011 (<a href=""http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program/fox-evidence-update"">http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program/fox-evidence-update</a>). Analysis of the pattern of fox records through time suggests the population may now be extinct (Caley <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Red Fox remains a potential threat to the Tasmanian Bettong.<br/><br/>Eastern Bettongs are threatened by predation by feral domestic Cats (Fancourt 2014). There is some evidence that the abundance or activity of feral Cats has increased in Tasmania following the decline of the Tasmanian Devil (<em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em>) (Hollings<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013), but the magnitude of this change is still unclear. Recent surveys show that Eastern Bettongs remain abundant in areas where feral cats are present, provided that habitat patches are sufficiently large (R. Gardiner <em>pers. comm. </em>2015). A very similar species, the Woylie or Brush-tailed Bettong <em>Bettongia penicillata</em>, has recently suffered major declines in south western Western Australia as a result of predation by feral Cats (Marlow <em>et al.</em> 2015). In that case, predation by feral Cats increased following suppression of Red Fox populations by poison baiting, which probably allowed population growth in feral Cats. If the abundance or activity of feral Cats were to increase in a similar way in Tasmania, it is possible that mortality of Eastern Bettongs would increase substantially and populations could decline. It is also possible that feral Cats threaten Eastern Bettongs by transmitting the disease toxoplasmosis, but the evidence from Western Australia suggests that direct predation is likely to be more significant (Marlow <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>The sensitivity of the Eastern Bettong to fragmentation of its dry forest and woodland habitat also suggests that further loss of habitat extent could lead to localized extinctions. Possibly, threats from fragmentation (and associated loss of habitat quality) and predation could interact, such that exposure of Eastern Bettongs to feral Cats is higher where habitat has been reduced or degraded, and cats also increase in abundance as a result of disturbances associated with habitat fragmentation. This suggests that even quite small changes in habitat or Cat abundance could be amplified to produce significant population declines.","<p>In Tasmania, this species is moderately common in suitable habitat but has been affected by past clearing of dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, especially in the midlands of Tasmania. Little of its habitat is protected within reserves and the highest densities occur on private land (DPIPWE 2012). It is sensitive to fragmentation of its habitat. Mammal spotlighting surveys carried out by the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment across Tasmania only detect low numbers of bettongs which have fluctuated widely over the past decade. Recent surveys using camera trapping show that in the midlands bettongs occur only in forest patches larger than approximately 50 ha (R. Gardiner <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). Abundance has been observed to fluctuate widely within areas of stable habitat, for reasons that are not understood (K. Proft <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015). On the other hand, Tasmanian bettongs sometimes occur at high abundance in plantation forests (M. Pauza <em>pers. comm.</em> 2012). One documented case shows a local population decline in response to increased activity of feral cats (Fancourt 2014), but more extensive surveys have not provided evidence for a general recent impact of cats on abundance (R. Gardiner and R. Hamer <em>pers. comm.</em> 2015).&#160;</p>",Unknown,"The Eastern Bettong formerly occurred throughout much of mainland south-eastern Australia from south-eastern Queensland to south-eastern South Australia, but is now extinct on mainland Australia.

The conservation programs that focus on the species are the continued exclusion of invasive predators from large fenced reserves on the mainland of Australia. These reserves are at Heirisson Prong, Yookamurra, Scotia and Roxby Downs. Subpopulations in these reserves have survived and reproduced for &gt;5 years. The success of other assisted colonisations is pending. Protection of these subpopulations consists of local eradication of predators, fencing to maintain exclusion, and continued monitoring and maintenance of fences. Lapses in such management could quickly result in subpopulation extinction.&#160;</p><p>If all such dependent populations were to be lost, the species would survive on only five offshore islands, and be assessed as Vu (D2). The island populations consist of three that survived the original decline of the species (Barrow, 235 km²; Bernier, 43 km²; and Dorre, 52 km²) as well as two where the species has been established by translocation (Boodie Island, 1.7 km²; and Faure Island 52 km²). These populations are monitored regularly, but not subjected to intensive management.&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>Boodies are thought to be the only Australian macropod to shelter in underground warrens, although it is possible that the extinct Nullarbor Dwarf Bettong <em>B. pusilla</em> also used warrens. Warrens on Bernier and Dorre Islands and on Heirisson Prong typically have two or three entrances in sandy soils, but on rocky Barrow Island, warrens may have up to 120 entrances (Short and Turner 1993). Warrens constructed by Boodies are still obvious in a variety of rocky and stony landscapes in central Australia and on the Nullarbor Plain (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 2007); rabbits now occupy some of these. Before the decline of Boodies, Brushtail Possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em> and Chuditch <em>Dasyurus geoffroii</em> and other animals also occupied their warrens.<br/><br/>Boodies are nocturnal and gregarious. They emerge from warrens after sunset and return before sunrise. Food is procured largely by digging and appears to be located by smell. They are omnivorous, eating underground fungi, fruit, seeds, tubers, roots, bulbs and arthropods, particularly termites. At Heirisson Prong the diet comprises hypogeal fungi, fruit, seed, forbs, and arthropods in winter, and browse from shrubs such as <em>Acacia ligulata</em>, <em>Senna chatelainiana</em>, <em>Eremophila</em> spp., <em>Pimelea microcephala</em>, and <em>Olearia </em>spp., fruit, seed, stem, and some forbs in summer (Robley <em>et al.</em> 2001). The average home range sizes for males and females at Heirisson Prong were 107 and 86 ha respectively (Robley 1999), and on Barrow Island were 133 and 98 ha (Short and Turner 1990) for males and females respectively.</p>","The current major threats to the natural populations of the species include: the accidental introduction of predators (introduced cats and foxes), fire, and disease (Richards 2005). Introduced rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than introduced predators. These same threats apply to varying degrees to the reintroduced populations. Extreme fluctuations in populations on islands are a threat, but this threat is seen as minor relative to the risk exotic predators being introduced (Short <em>et al.</em> 1997). It is also unclear to what extent population fluctuations occur at the reintroduction sites on the mainland. This species would likely qualify as having ""extreme fluctuations"" in population in terms of the IUCN criteria (IUCN 2001) if it were still restricted to the islands off of Western Australia. This is because these fluctuations are tied to climatic extremes that are likely to be synchronous in these locations, but unlikely to be in synchrony with fluctuations (should they occur) in reintroduced populations in South Australia and New South Wales.<br/><br/>Presumably, overgrazing of suitable habitat by cattle and rabbits, loss of wooded areas to agriculture, as well as changes to the fire regime contributed to the decline of the species on mainland Australia. Introduced species, particularly feral cats and foxes, are thought also to have led to its mainland demise (Richards 2005). Feral cats are a proven threat to this species, as they predated on all animals in a trial reintroduction in the Gibson Desert, Western Australia (A. Burbidge pers. comm.). It is believed to have been extirpated from Dirk Hartog Island by foxes and/or feral cats (Burbidge and Short 2008). The role of disease is unclear, but may have been a historical threat.<br/><br/>Black Rats were a historical threat to the species on Boodie Island. It suffered greater losses, however, due to a rat-baiting program that accidentally eradicated the species from island in 1985. In 1993 the species was reintroduced to Boodie Island from Barrow Island (Morris 2002).","Boodies were once very abundant under good seasonal conditions on the mainland. Recent estimates of numbers on islands and mainland islands are Barrow Island 3400 (1988; Short and Turner 1993), Boodie Island 200 (2011; K. D. Morris <em>pers. comm</em>.), Bernier Island 842 (2010), Dorre Island 3291 (2010), Faure Island 3000-4000 (2012; Sarah Legge <em>pers. comm</em>.), Heirisson Prong 400-500 (2012; Jeff Short, <em>pers. comm</em>.), Arid Recovery Project 2260 (2010), Scotia 1300 (2012) and Yookamurra 260 (2012) (Sarah Legge <em>pers. comm</em>).

It became restricted to three islands off the Western Australian coast: Barrow, Bernier and Dorre. </p>    <p>The Boodie was reintroduced to Boodie Island in 1993 and was introduced to Faure Island in 2002.

In the western deserts, Aboriginal people reported that they occupied sand plains and dunes with spinifex (<em>Triodia</em> spp.) hummock grassland. The remnant subpopulations in south-western Australia inhabit woodlands and adjacent heaths with a dense understorey of shrubs, particularly <em>Gastrolobium</em> spp., which contain monofluoroacetic acid, the compound present as sodium monofluoroacetate in the vertebrate pesticide ‘1080’. Diet is largely underground fungi, although it includes tubers, bulbs and seeds. Woylies can store seed in their cheek pouches for later caching and are a major distributor of fungal spores and seeds (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2005). Their digging also has a positive impact on the non-wetting property of soils (Garkaklis<em> et al</em>. 1998). </p>    <p>They are solitary animals but nest sharing (usually mother and young at heel) has been recorded (Sampson 1971, Christensen and Leftwich 1980, Start <em>et al</em>. 1995). They occupy home ranges, the size of which varies between habitats, sites and according to Woylie density. Small home ranges (less than 6&#160;ha) are generally observed at high density occurrences (Nelson 1989 in Nelson <em>et al</em>. 1992; Hide 2006). Males tend to have larger home ranges than females (Sampson 1971, Leftwich 1983), although this is not always so when Woylies are at higher densities (Yeatman 2010).</p>","The major reason for past decline has been predation by Red Foxes and feral cats, exacerbated in the deserts by changed fire regimes. The recent crash in numbers is thought to be primarily due to feral cats, although exotic disease may be involved. Inappropriate fire regimes may exacerbate fox and cat predation.","<p>Accounts by early settlers (e.g. Facey 1981) and Aboriginal people (e.g. Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988) demonstrate that Woylies were once abundant. In arid Australia Woylies declined after European settlement and survived the establishment of the feral Cat, but disappeared soon after the establishment of the Red Fox (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988). Abundance in the four remnant Western Australian wheatbelt subpopulations has varied, with Sampson (1971) at Tutanning and Christensen (1980) at Perup finding numbers to be relatively high during the 1960s and 1970s. However, numbers fluctuated, e.g. Kinnear <em>et al</em>. (2002) found Woylies to be rare at Tutanning in 1984. Trap success rates at Tutanning increased from c. 2% in 1984 to c. 28% in 1992 following the implementation of fox control (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2010). Following the introduction of widespread fox control under ‘Western Shield’ in 1996, Woylie numbers rapidly increased at all four of the original locations and translocations were conducted to several sites in the northern jarrah forest and wheatbelt in Western Australia, a total of 46 translocations in all, and to sites in eastern Australia (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2008). </p>    <p>From about 2000, there was a significant decline in all free-ranging Woylie populations, natural and reintroduced (Groom 2010). At a species level Woylies were found to have declined by c. 90% from a peak of c. 250&#160;000 individuals in 1999 to 33&#160;000 in 2010. The largest subpopulation, at Upper Warren, declined by 95% from an estimated peak of 215&#160;000 in 1999 (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011). A major research program coordinated by the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife investigated the reasons for the decline including predation (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011; 2013; N. Marlow and P. de Tores <em>pers. comm</em>.) and disease (e.g. Botero <em>et al</em>. 2013), with several further papers yet to be published.</p>    <p>Forty-one Woylies were translocated to the Perup Sanctuary mainland island in October-December 2010. In November 2012, 161 independent Woylie individuals were captured but due to trap saturation (80 traps x 4 nights) an accurate estimate could not be achieved. The number is probably around 200 (A. Wayne pers. comm.).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Formerly very widespread, Woylies occupied most of semi-arid and arid Australia, mostly south of the tropics, including the arid and semi-arid zones of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, and possibly extended north along the east coast into Queensland, the remnant of this population now being accepted as <em>Bettongia tropica</em>. Woylies also occurred on Saint Francis and St Peter Islands, South Australia (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 1996). Burbidge <em>et al</em>. (2009), using modern, historical and subfossil records, found that Woylies (excluding <em>B. tropica</em>) are known to have occurred in 28 of Australia’s 85 bioregions and that they are now extinct in all but two.</p>    <p>By 1970, they remained only in four subpopulations in south-western Australia: Dryandra, Tutanning, Kingston and Perup. Pacioni <em>et al</em>. (2011) used a molecular approach (12 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA) to investigate relationships between these subpopulations. </p>    <p>In 1975, the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service began a breeding program for the species at Para Wirra Recreation Park from animals sourced from Perth Zoo with the goal of providing stock to re-establish the species in South Australia. The first experimental releases were onto two small islands, Bird Club Island (8 ha) in 1979 and Venus Bay ‘Island A’ (15 ha) in 1980, followed by three larger islands, St Francis Island (809ha) in 1980, St Peter Island (3493 ha) in 1981 and Wedge Island (947 ha) in 1983 (Delroy <em>et al</em>. 1986, Freegard 2008, Yeatman and Groom 2012). Woylies did not survive on Bird Club Island, probably due to foxes accessing the island. Neither did they survive on St Francis Island (reasons unknown) (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 1996). These translocated Woylie subpopulations are genetically depauperate (Pacioni 2010), having been derived mostly from the small Para Wirra founder group.</p>    <p>There have been numerous reintroductions to parts of the south-west of Western Australia and some to New South Wales, but some have failed in the medium- to long-term (Priddell and Wheeler 2004, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011; Yeatman and Groom 2012). Remaining unfenced subpopulations from these reintroductions in Western Australia are Julimar Forest (1995-2011), Avon Valley National Park (2002-2004), Boyagin Nature Reserve (1992), several sites in the northern and central jarrah forest (the current status of some of these is unknown), Batalling Forest (1982), and North Karlgarin Nature Reserve (2005).<br/></p>    Recently, ‘insurance’ subpopulations in fenced mainland islands have been established at Whiteman Park Recreation and Conservation Reserve (near Perth) and Perup Sanctuary (a 420 ha fenced area, east of Manjimup) (Yeatman and Groom 2012). Neither of these has yet persisted for five years and cannot be included in this evaluation. A small number of Woylies have recently been translocated to the fenced Wadderin Sanctuary, Western Australia.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Hall <em>et al</em>.

(1995) was the second edition of Woylie Recovery Plan for the period 1994-2003, written with the expectation that the species could be removed from the threatened species list within a short period of time. Woylies were removed from the Commonwealth and Western Australian threatened species lists in 1996 following an assessment of status (Start <em>et al</em>. 1998). However, from about 2000, Woylies have suffered a significant ongoing decline and they became again the subject of conservation research and management. Woylie conservation was then guided by an interim recovery plan (Freegard 2008). A revised national recovery plan was finalised in 2012 (Yeatman and Groom 2012). This recovery plan, guided by a national Recovery Team, has seven recovery actions:</p>  <p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Verify the causes of the decline and suppression of recovery and implement remedial action to address these.</p>  <p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Minimise predation by introduced foxes and cats at priority sites.</p>  <p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Maintain or improve the health, genetic diversity, relative value and viability of wild populations.</p>  <p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Maintain genetic diversity of the insurance captive populations at least at 2012 levels.</p>  <p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Maintain captive population sizes sufficient to act as source populations for future translocations.</p>  <p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Undertake targeted translocations as re-introductions (and as introductions where necessary) to achieve an enhanced conservation status for the species.</p>  <p>·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Inform and educate the community about, and involve the community in, recovery actions.</p>    <p>It is too soon to evaluate progress.</p>      <p>There has been considerable research and management of Woylies in the south-west of Western Australia over a long period of time. Recently, with a serious decline of unknown causes under way, the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation initiated a major research program to investigate Woylie decline and that of other ‘critical weight range’ (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989) mammals. The ‘Mesopredator release’ project and ‘Woylie conservation research project’ involved the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre, DEC staff, and people from Murdoch University, Perth Zoo, Australian Wildlife Conservancy, South Australian Department of Environment and Heritage, Australian Wildlife Health Network, Wildlife Disease Association (Australasia), University of Adelaide, Data Analysis Australia, UWA and a number of other professionals and organisations. The major hypotheses examined were that the declines were due to fox predation, cat predation (possibly partly due to mesopredator release), epizootic disease, and/or changes to food resources.

The subpopulation in the Upper Warren (Perup) was the largest prior to 2002 and underwent a severe decline of &gt;95% (probably &gt;99%) between 1998 and 2009. Remaining fragmented subpopulations in coastal habitats are also declining rapidly, equating to a population decline of &gt;80% in the past 10 years. With rainfall in the south-west of Western Australia predicted to decline further and continuing urban coastal development, there is a projected continuing decline of &gt;80% within the next 10 years.</p>","The Western Ringtail Possum is an arboreal marsupial with a maximum body weight of 1,330 g for both sexes (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2005a). It formerly occurred in a variety of vegetation types including coastal Peppermint (<em>Agonis flexuosa</em>) forests and woodlands and Peppermint / Tuart (<em>Eucalyptus gomphocephala</em>) associations, eucalypt associations of Jarrah (<em>E. marginata</em>) / Marri (<em>Corymbia calophylla</em>) / Wandoo (<em>E. wandoo</em>) (Christensen <em>et al</em>. 1985), Wandoo / Casuarina (<em>Allocasuarina huegeliana</em>) woodland in the wheatbelt, and presumably eucalypt woodland, mallee and mallee heath from the Hampton Tableland (Baynes 1987) and other areas. It is now almost exclusively restricted to coastal and near coastal Peppermint woodland between the Australind - Eaton area and Waychinicup National Park (Burbidge and de Tores 1998). The Upper Warren area had the only known sites where Western Ringtail Possums recently persisted in significant numbers in the absence of Peppermint.<br/><br/>In coastal Peppermint habitat, Western Ringtail Possums build dreys as nesting/resting sites and uses tree hollows where available (e.g., Tuart and Marri). Where protection from introduced predators is provided, a wide range of nest sites on or near the ground has been recorded, including low shrub thickets (e.g., Basket Bush (<em>Spyridium globulosum</em>), Orange Wattle (<em>Acacia saligna</em>), Summer-scented Wattle (<em>A. rostellifera</em>)), sedges and rushes (ringtails have been commonly recorded nesting on the ground under sword sedge (<em>Lepidosperma gladiatum</em>) (How <em>et al</em>. 1984, Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994a). In the absence of predator control and in the absence of Peppermint or other nesting/drey material, or where fire is frequent, tree hollows and hollow logs are used almost exclusively, although urban animals will use roof spaces and other shelter. At translocation sites in the Jarrah forest near Dwellingup, where foxes are controlled, 20% of over 400 recorded day rest locations were at or below 1.5 m in height. These sites included hollow logs on the ground, fallen branches and debris on the ground, coppicing jarrah stumps, in and under Grass Tree (<em>Xanthorrhoea</em> sp.) leaf ‘skirts’ and in Water Bush (<em>Bossiaea</em> sp.) and Karri Hazel (<em>Trymalium</em> sp.) In Jarrah forest near Manjimup, where foxes are also controlled, up to 70% of diurnal refuges were sites other than tree hollows, including the skirts of grass trees (<em>Xanthorrhoea</em> sp.), stump hollows and hollow logs (Burbidge and de Tores 1998, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>The diet of the Western Ringtail Possum is variable. When available, Peppermint leaves form the majority of the diet. In their absence, the dominant myrtaceous species are preferred (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994b). In urban areas (e.g., Bunbury and Busselton), they are known to feed on a variety of garden species, including rose bush leaves and flowers and a variety of fruits. The digestive system reflects adaptation to myrtaceous and other foliage of low nutritional value. Western Ringtail Possums are caecum fermenters having a large caecum where fine digestive material is retained. Larger, coarse, less nutritious material is passed more rapidly. Ringtail Possums are also caecotrophic (i.e., during the day they ingest softer, finer faecal material to assist in returning bacteria to the caecum to aid digestion: Hume and Sakaguchi (1993), Hume <em>et al</em>. (1994)). Successful recruitment depends on seasonal availability of high-quality foliage. When food quality is poor, the sex ratio of young is biased towards males, and recruitment may fail (B. Jones pers. comm). Wayne (2005) reported that 84% of monitored deaths (mostly linked to predation) occurred between April and September, when both male and female body condition was significantly lower than October-March.<br/><br/>Wayne <em>et al</em>. (2006) investigated associations between the relative abundance of the Western Ringtail Possum and anthropogenic disturbances at local and landscape scales within the publicly-managed Jarrah forests of south-western Australia. Logging, fire, fox control and forest fragmentation were investigated in relation to the relative abundance of ringtails at 90 sites within an area of 285,000 ha of the Upper Warren east of Manjimup; the location of the last remaining substantial population of the Western Ringtail Possum in jarrah forest. Overall, abundance was greatest in areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. At the local scale, abundance was negatively associated with greater fire intensity. At the landscape scale, it was positively associated with fox control and negatively associated with forest fragmentation and distance from non-remnant vegetation (i.e., agriculture and tree plantations). Abundance was also greatest in predominantly unlogged landscapes and in forests that had been regrowing for an average of 40 years since the landscape was most recently logged; in other words, where logging was historically least intense.<br/><br/>Western Ringtail Possums are often killed in moderate or high intensity fires (Inions 1985) and by logging (Morris <em>et al</em>. 2000). Both impacts also expose survivors to elevated predation. Where most resident possums use predominantly low shelter sites, or dreys in the mid-storey, even low intensity fires can severely reduce numbers. Most resident subpopulations appear to require some substantial or dominant proportion of their local habitat to have remained largely unburned and unlogged for periods of at least 2-4 decades (Wayne 2008, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). By 2012, it was clear that drey-using fragmented subpopulations (in habitat with only rare, small fire events) were more resilient and persistent than subpopulations in habitat subject to broad-scale fire effects (wildfires or low-intensity prescribed fires).<br/><br/>Young have been recorded as being born throughout the year, with peaks in April to July and September to November (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994b, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2005a), but the breeding season can vary. Sexual maturity is reached at about one year. Litter size is usually one, with litters of two being rare, unlike the Common Ringtail Possum (<em>P. peregrinus</em>). Sex ratios can vary, depending on food quality: females predominate when food quality is high, males when it is low. Longevity is unknown. Life spans of <em>P. peregrinus</em> to eight years have been recorded (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1990) and longevity in captivity for that species is up to 10 years (AnAge 2012). Available information suggests that most Western Ringtail Possums do not survive in the wild beyond 3-6 years. Generation length for the Western Ringtail Possum is here assumed to be <em>ca</em> 3 years.","<p>Current threats are:</p>  <ol><li>The drying climate, affecting the nutritional quality of food and hence survival and recruitment. Rainfall has declined and continues to decline throughout the south west of Australia. T2014 and 2015 have been the, or close to the, driest on record near Albany. Albany mean rainfall (1877 to 2014): 929 mm; 2014: 638 (no data from December, mean is 30 mm, if 30 mm added = 668 mm); 2015: 621 mm (lowest on record). Busselton mean (1877 to 2014): 813.6 mm; 2014: 591 mm; 2015: 568 mm. Western Ringtail Possums ‘are among the species most likely to be impacted by predicted climate change in the south-west because they have very specific habitat and dietary requirements, have a poor ability to migrate and have lost large areas of habitat. In addition they are sensitive to drought-induced stress. Over the past 30 years there has been an approximate 20 per cent decline in rainfall in the south-west of WA, with more reductions in rainfall and increased temperatures predicted due to global climate change (Timbal 2004). These changes could result in further contraction of the species to the most fertile and mesic remnants of their extant range (Wayne 2005, Jones and Francesconi 2007)’ (Recovery Plan p. 10). Almost all remaining occurrences are associated with older-growth Peppermint, but few stands now seem to provide suitable nutrition for the species to survive and recruit </li><li>Increasing temperature. ‘Western Ringtail Possums are known to be susceptible to heat stress and can easily overheat at temperatures of 35°C (Yin 2006). Western Ringtail Possums have been observed to use evaporative cooling in hot weather by applying saliva to the forelimbs or panting (Jones <em>et al.</em> 1994b). Jones <em>et al</em>. (1994b) observed that in areas where dreys were used, Western Ringtail Possums went to the ground over several hot days. Western Ringtail Possums are the smallest of the specialist marsupial folivores indicating that they live close to the ecological and physiological limits of viability (B. Jones pers. comm. 2002)’ (Recovery Plan pp. 6-7). As well, increasing temperatures exacerbate soil moisture reduction and further affect the nutritional quality of food.</li><li>Land clearing. Land clearing for urban development remains a threat in the Busselton – Augusta near coastal strip and near Albany. Land clearing continues despite application of the EPBC Act guidelines that aim to assist in determining whether a proposed action is likely to have a significant impact on the Western Ringtail Possum on the southern Swan Coastal Plain. Most remaining habitat is on private land; thus the major land management is via planning controls, not via biodiversity legislation.</li><li>Feral predators. Translocation experiments in the past and other data demonstrate that Red Foxes and feral Cats are major threats, especially where the canopy becomes more open due to ‘parkland clearing’ and after fire. Native predators also impact the species.</li><li>Fire. Fire reduces food availability and opens up the canopy causing ringtails to spend more time on the ground where they can be predated by foxes and cats.</li><li>Tree decline and insect outbreaks. Coastal Peppermint decline, gum leaf skeletoniser and <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback in Jarrah, Tuart decline and other tree declines have resulted in extensive but mainly localised reductions in food and habitat quality.</li><li>Competition for tree hollows. Increased numbers of Brushtail Possums where fox baiting occurs leads to competition for hollows: brushtails are more aggressive and will evict ringtails. Hollow loss is also caused by logging and feral bees.</li><li>Logging. Western Ringtail Possums are more abundant in unlogged forest or where logging has been least intense; logging leads to local mortality including via increased feral Cat predation. However, current WRP distribution does not now significantly overlap areas to be logged to a significant degree.</li><li>Domestic dogs. ‘In urban environments predation or injury by domestic dogs can be frequent (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 1998). High levels of dog ownership within the City of Busselton create dog densities at four to eight times greater per hectare than the average fox density in the south-west forests (K. Williams pers. comm. 2006)’ (Recovery Plan, p.8). Ravens are a threat in urban areas where their numbers have increased.</li><li>A plausible future threat is myrtle rust, which significantly affects peppermint (<em>Agonis flexuosa</em>), in eastern Australia where it is planted horticulturally, noting that peppermint is now the main habitat and food tree for WRPs.</li></ol>  <p>Note that some threats are synergistic.</p>","How <em>et al</em>. (1987) found that subpopulations between Busselton and Albany were small and rapidly diminishing. In the Upper Warren area, Western Ringtail Possums have declined severely in abundance (&gt;95%, probably &gt;99%) between 1998 and 2009 (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012) from an inferred pre-decline abundance of &gt;10,000 individuals (A. Wayne pers comm). Jones <em>et al</em>. (2007) found high-density remnant subpopulations varying between &lt;2 and 20 adults/ha in the Siesta-Kealy area west of Busselton, and Harewood (2009) found densities of <em>ca</em> 13 animals/ha in Busselton urban bushland reserves in 2008 and 2009; however, these high densities are exceptional—many remnant areas now harbour few animals. Scat scores at Ludlow National Park and nearby sites revealed a 30-55% site decline between 2002 and 2012 (B. Jones pers. comm). The results of surveys carried out by consultants for developers are generally unavailable; however, anecdotal and observational evidence indicates that other remnant subpopulations have recently undergone significant decline (B. Jones pers. comm). The major cause of the decline is thought to be climate change (drying and warming) leading to declining food quality: Western Ringtail Possums require relatively high quality food to recruit successfully due to their specialized digestive system. Other implicated factors include continuing habitat loss and fragmentation due to urban development, and predation by introduced Red Foxes and feral cats.<br/><br/>Recent (2015) estimates by Dr B. Jones for each of the five subpopulations are:<br/><ul><li>Southern Swan:&#160; 2,000</li><li>Cape to Cape:&#160; 500</li><li>Other Forest Rivers:&#160; 300</li><li>Upper Warren:&#160; 100</li><li>Around Albany:&#160; 500<br/></li></ul>This implies a probable 2015 total of about 3,400 adult Western Ringtail Possums.<br/><br/>The most recent estimate of numbers at Karakamia, made in 2010, was 38 animals, and spotlighting since then suggests a stable subpopulation (S. Legge pers. comm).<br/><br/>The Upper Warren subpopulation was estimated to be at least 11,000 mature individuals in 2006. Numbers in other regional areas were also significantly higher in 2006, with a total estimate of the population in 2006 being at least 18,000. Thus, available information strongly implies a population size reduction of &gt;80% over the past 10 years. Because rainfall is projected to decline further in south-western Australia, and habitat destruction is likely to continue, this reduction is expected to continue.",Decreasing,"The extent of occurrence of Western Ringtail Possums has contracted in the past and severely contracted in the recent past. Formerly it was patchily distributed across much of south-western Western Australia from 120 km south-east of Geraldton (where it is known from surface cave deposits) to the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain (where it is also known from surface cave deposits), with the most inland recent records being from Tutanning Nature Reserve east of Pingelly (Shortridge 1909; Sampson 1971; Christensen <em>et al</em>. 1985; How <em>et al</em>. 1987; Baynes 1987; Jones <em>et al</em>. 1994a,b; Jones and Hillcox 1995; Burbidge and de Tores 1998).<br/><br/>By <em>ca</em> 1980, about 80% of the original range was no longer occupied (Jones 2004). It persisted in the coastal strip between Bunbury and Albany (with the range extending inland in riparian habitat between the Collie and Blackwood Rivers), and in the Upper Warren region (Perup Nature Reserve, Greater Kingston National Park and adjacent State forest: Burbidge and de Tores 1998, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2006). There are a few post-2000 Western Ringtail Possum records across some inland areas in south-western Australia from Yornup in the north to Northcliffe in the south, near Vasse Highway, near Carey forest block in the west and Lake Muir in the east (B. Jones pers. comm).<br/><br/>Currently, it occurs patchily in coastal areas from near Bunbury to the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park (with a small isolated translocated subpopulation further north near Dawesville) and near Albany (B. Jones pers. comm). Most of these fragmented habitat remnants are on private land. The largest recent inland subpopulation in the Upper Warren had declined to near extirpation by the mid- to late-2000s (Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2012), so there are now only two subpopulations.<br/><br/>It has been reintroduced to Lane-Poole Conservation Park near Dwellingup, Yalgorup National Park south of Mandurah and Leschenault Conservation Park near Bunbury. However, apart from some Yalgorup translocated animals establishing away from the release site near Dawesville, these reintroductions have failed due to poor-quality food resulting from a drying climate (B. Jones pers. comm.) and to feral cat predation (K. Morris pers. comm). There is a small subpopulation of &lt;50 mature individuals (and therefore not included in this evaluation) in the Karakamia mainland island (Australian Wildlife Conservancy), near Perth.<br/><br/>There are five subpopulations: 'Southern Swan Coastal Plain', 'Cape to Cape' (Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin), 'Other Forest Rivers', 'Upper Warren' and 'Around Albany'.",,Terrestrial,"Recovery goals, objectives, criteria for success and failure, and recovery actions are described in the Recovery Plan (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2014); however, this was drafted when the species was listed as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The Recovery Plan includes &gt;30 actions. The most urgent ones are:<br/><br/><em><strong>Monitoring</strong></em>. It is clear that there is insufficient monitoring, especially noting the short-term crash that happened at the Upper Warren where the subpopulation went from &gt;10 000 (probably many tens of thousands) to near zero in about 10 years, and average species’ longevity of c. 3 years. Of particular concern is declining rainfall and increasing temperatures and resulting effects on survival and recruitment, not only in the Bunbury to Augusta area, but also near Albany where there has been a series of dry years and severe, lightning-caused fires in the conservation estate.<br/><br/><strong><em>Research into effects of drying climate, nutritional status of food and how it relates to survival and recruitment</em></strong>. This should include research into the effects of rainfall and artificial watering on the nutritional quality of food and hence recruitment.<br/><br/><strong><em>Predation</em></strong>. Conduct experiments with Eradicat (registered feral cat bait) in key Western Ringtail Possum habitat and measure prey response.<br/><br/><strong><em>Captive breeding</em></strong>.

45187424,41280,Lepus europaeus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The European Hare is confirmed Least Concern; it is widespread and abundant across its  geographic range (Flux and Angermann 1990, Schai-Braun and Hackländer  2016, Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018). There is evidence of population  declines beginning in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century in association with the  intensification of agricultural practices (Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2018). It is listed under Appendix III of the Bern Convention in Europe  (as “<em>Lepus capensis</em> (<em>europaeus</em>)” Council of Europe 1979). Several  European countries have placed the European Hare on their Red List as  ""Near Threatened"" or ""Threatened"" (Reichlin <em>et al.</em> 2006). There is increasing concern regarding the status of regional  forms of this species (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). However, the  status in Europe and the European Union is “Least Concern” (Temple and  Terry 2007).","The European Hare is a highly adaptable species that can persist in  numerous habitat types from sea level to alpine areas (Hackländer and  Schai-Braun 2018). There is a positive association with hare abundance  and habitat diversity (Smith, Jennings and Harris 2005). Various surveys  have investigated habitat preferences of European Hares. As the study  areas vary considerably, the results diverge also substantially.  However, fallow land is preferred consistently in all studies, whereas  residential areas are avoided (Schai-Braun <em>et al.</em> 2013,  Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). When available, weeds and wild grasses  are selected by the European Hare, however, intensified agro-practices  have reduced this food source resulting in the selection of crop species  (Reichlin, Klansek and Hackländer 2006, Schai-Braun <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The  European Hare averages three litters/yr, but can vary from one to five  litters/yr (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). Litter size can vary with  respect to the season, smaller litters produced earlier in the season  and larger litters later (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2018). The birth  weight of the European Hare is approximately 100 g (Hackländer and  Schai-Braun 2018). Gestation is 42 days and reproduction occurs year  round in suitable habitats. In northern ranges or higher altitude  reproduction is restricted to summer (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).  Physiological age is 8-12 years (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).  Females reach maturity around 4-5 months Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2018).","A study reviewing available literature regarding population  densities in connection with habitat that was identified as primarily  farmland from 12 European countries, concluded that the primary cause of  the European Hare decline was intensification of agriculture (Smith <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2005). It is inferred that this threat is pertinent to the species  across its geographic range where farming is practiced. Smith <em>et al.</em>  (2005) also identified negative associations with predation and  precipitation in respect to abundance. However, ""field size,  temperature, precipitation, and hunting had no effect on density  throughout Europe"" (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Greece, Spain, France  and Denmark, the restocking of hares from other regions or countries to  complement hare densities for hunting has been identified as a threat to  regional gene pools (Mamuris <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001,  Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). This issue has also been identified as  a concern for the Cantabric population in Spain (Palacios <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>  2004). Disease is an additional threat to the European Hare and several  have been identified as the principle sources of mortality (Lamarque,  Barrat and Moutou 1996). These diseases are European Brown Hare Syndrome  (EBHS), Pasteurellosis, Yersiniosis (Pseudo-tuberculosis), Coccidiosis  and Tularaemia (Lamarque <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lavazza and Cooke 2018).<br/><br/>Genetic  diversity of the European Hare in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of  Germany indicates that hare populations still retain sufficient  diversity (Fickel <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005).  However, it is cautioned that restricted gene flow could eventually lead  to allelic fixation and inbreeding depression within populations that  become isolated (Fickel <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005).","Populations of the European Hare have been experiencing declines in many  areas across its geographic range in Europe (Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2018). Natural population densities are about 2/100 ha, but can reach  up to 275/100 ha in highly suitable habitats (Hackländer and Schai-Braun  2016).<br/><br/>A study conducted in the Czech Republic found mean hare  densities were highest in habitat with the following characteristics  (Pikula <em>et al.</em> 2004): elevation (sea level up to 200 m); annual  snow cover duration (40-60 days); mean annual precipitation (450-700  mm); annual sunshine duration (1801-2000 hrs); mean annual air  temperature (&gt;10˚C).<br/><br/>Population dynamics are mainly affected  by juvenile mortality due to annual differences in weather conditions,  mechanical activities in agricultural land, diseases, and predation  (Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).",Decreasing,"The current Eurasian distribution of the European Hare extends from the  northern provinces of Spain, to introduced populations in the United  Kingdom and southern regions of Scandinavia, south to northern portions  of the Middle East, and has naturally expanded east to sections of  Siberia. The south-eastern boundary of its range runs from the southern  Caspian Sea south to the Persian Gulf (Flux and Angermann 1990,  Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016, Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018). This  species has been introduced as a game species extensively to countries  across the globe, including eastern Australia, New Zealand, South  America up to 28°S, Canada, and the United States (Great Lakes Area), as  well as numerous islands in the Indian and Atlantic Ocean (Hackländer  and Schai-Braun 2018). This species can be found at elevations ranging  from sea level up to 2,400 m (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016).","The European Hare is recognized as an important game species  throughout its historical distribution, including those areas where it  has been introduced (Flux and Angermann 1990, Schai-Braun and Hackländer  2016, Hackländer and Schai-Braun 2018).",Terrestrial,"The European Hare is recognized as an important game species  throughout its distribution and as such conservation measures are  required to halt declining populations (Flux and Angermann 1990). The  recent decline of this species has garnered it protection under the Bern  Convention as an Appendix III listing (Council of Europe 1979). In  Norway, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, population declines have  resulted in country-specific Red Listing as ""near threatened"" or  ""threatened"" (Reichlin <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Research is needed to  determine population dynamics specific to habitat type and the effects  habitat change has on life history parameters with regard to declines  (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). There is a lack of understanding as to why  hare numbers are low in pastoral landscapes and therefore, research  should be conducted within this habitat type with particular emphasis  paid to demography and behavioral ecology (Smith <em>et al.</em>  2005).When population declines are the direct result of agricultural  intensification, which results in increased application of fertilizer,  landscape homogeneity and mechanization, population declines of the  European Hare can be countered by augmenting habitat to boost  heterogeneity (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>In Spain, molecular  phylogenetic studies have shown that the Cantabric population has unique  mtDNA in relation to other European populations (Palacios <em>et al.</em>  2004). As an important hunting species, declining numbers have prompted  the importation of non-Iberian hares (from France and elsewhere) to  supplement hare densities (Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2004). In an effort to conserve this population's gene pool, a captive breeding program has been implemented (Palacios <em>et al.</em>  2004). As of 2003 this program has successfully bred leverets and in  2004 turned its focus to increasing genetic variability by introducing  individuals from new localities (Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Northern Bettongs are heavily dependent on truffles (the underground fruiting bodies of fungi) as a food source during the wetter parts of the year. The more than 35 species eaten comprise over 45% of their diet, depending on location and season. They also eat roots, tubers, the underground parts of grasses, small invertebrates, and seeds; Cockatoo Grass <em>Alloteropsis semialata</em> is particularly important food when truffle abundance is low (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bateman and Johnson 2011).

Baker pers. comm).</p>    <p>Home ranges are typically 50-70 hectares, but may be as large as 120 hectares (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2008). Vernes (2003) found that male Northern Bettongs have a larger range of movements than females, 72 ± 10.9 ha versus 49 ± 8.4 ha. However, both genders had a high mean rate of movement while foraging. Ranges overlapped for individuals, both between and within sexes. At the site studied by Vernes (2000), small-scale, low intensity fire had no impact on the location or use of individuals’ home ranges. Both during and after a fire, individuals remained within the limits of their movements prior to the fire and there was no direct or indirect mortality of bettongs associated with fire. Despite the lack of broad-scale changes to movements associated with fire, there were clear changes in the fine scale movements and foraging patterns of bettongs immediately after a fire. Search effort for truffles becomes focussed, the level of foraging success is higher and the foraging path more sinuous in recently burnt areas compared to unburnt areas (Vernes 2000). At the site studied by Vernes (2000), fire did not completely remove cover, with bettongs particularly seeking shelter under boulders which are common at the site; the impacts of fire may be different elsewhere, particularly sites on rhyolite (much of the Coane Range population) where boulders are rare. </p>","The main threats tot his species are:<br/><ol><li>Predation by feral cats (moderate to severe): feral Cats shown to be a significant predator of the closely-related Woylie in south-western Australia.</li><li>Climate change (moderate to severe): detailed climate modelling has shown that extended drought is likely to reduce the distribution of Northern Bettong by altering the productivity of its major food resources, and is plausibly a cause of the apparent decline of the Coane Range population (Bateman 2010; Bateman <em>et al</em>. 2012 a, b).&#160;</li><li>Small, relictual subpopulations (moderate): only Lamb Range subpopulations appear large enough to be self sustaining (Dennis 2001, 2012); it is not known whether small populations on Mt Windsor and Coane Range still persist.</li><li>Habitat change due to changed fire regimes (moderate): past declines are thought to relate to changes in habitat structure and suitability for both the bettong and the fungi and grasses it consumes; changes were probably influenced by changed fire regimes (Bateman and Johnson 2011, Dennis 2012); small-scale, low-intensity fire has little effect, at least in habitats where physical cover (e.g. boulders) is available (Vernes 2000, Vernes and Pope 2001), but may be significant in other habitats, and especially in combination with Foxes and feral Cats.</li><li>Competition from Pigs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) (moderate): impact unclear: evidence of their impact is still scant but they known to consume (and cause reduction in abundance of) truffles and Cockatoo Grass tubers (A.

By 1910, populations had been reduced to a number of scattered colonies in the area enclosed by Robe, Kingston and Beachport on the South Australian coast, and Naracoorte and Penola further to the east, near Mt Gambier. By 1924 only one small group was known to survive on Konetta Station, about halfway between Robe and Penola. An attempt was made to transfer some of the population to a sanctuary on Kangaroo Island, but this failed.

The overall rate of decline in population size over the last 18-24 years (=three generations) was estimated at about 28% by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012), with this rate substantially influenced by a severe decline in inland regions most exposed to recent drought. A separate expert elicitation process involving independent estimates (from 15 Koala experts) of population size in every bioregion inhabited by Koalas concluded that the Koala population size reduction or projected reduction over three generations is a mean of 29%, albeit with substantial variation amongst experts in estimation of this rate (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012). Climate change is expected to lead to an increased rate of population reduction over the next 20-30 years, and the impacts of other threats will magnify over this period. Here we consider that the conservation status of the Koala is border-line between Near Threatened and Vulnerable, but we adopt a precautionary assessment given the proximity of the estimated current and projected rate of decline to the threshold, and published assessments of the likelihood of additional and compound impacts due to climate change (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014)","<p>The Koala is an arboreal folivorous marsupial. It occurs in forests and woodlands, typically dominated by eucalyptus&#160;species. In inland (semi-arid) portions of its range, it occurs mainly in riparian woodlands (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2002, Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011). Elsewhere distribution may be associated particularly with soil fertility (and hence foliage nutrient content) (Moore and Foley 2000). The Koala has a specialist diet, mostly limited to foliage of <em>Eucalyptus</em> species, with occasional intake of leaves of other plant (mostly <em>Myrtaceous</em>) genera (Martin and Handasyde 1999; Moore and Foley 2000, 2005). At high population densities, Koalas can defoliate preferred tree species, causing tree death and subsequent Koala population crash (Menkhorst 2004, 2008).<br/><br/>The Koala is mostly solitary, but individuals have extensive overlap in home ranges. Home range size varies substantially with forest structure and productivity, and males typically have larger home ranges than females. In a coastal forest in New South Wales, average home range size was 10 ha (for females) to 20 ha (for males) (Lassau <em>et al</em>. 2008); in inland Queensland home ranges were 100 ha (for females) to 135 ha (for males) (Ellis<em> et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Breeding is seasonal, with births (typically of single young) in October-May. Females can produce young at annual intervals, but births per adult female per year average 0.3-0.8 (McLean 2003). Sexual maturity is reached at 18 months (Jackson 2007). In the wild, longevity of 12 (for males) to 15 years (for females) has been reported (Martin and Handasyde 1999). Generation length is 6-8 years (Phillips 2000).</p>","Current threats to this species include continued habitat destruction, fragmentation, and modification (which makes them vulnerable to predation by dogs, vehicle strikes, and other factors), bushfires, and disease, as well as drought associated mortality in habitat fragments. Public concern for the species is high. There are management problems with many populations; remnant populations living at high densities in isolated patches of habitat are at greatest risk (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Effective management of some of the threats on the mainland could lead to excessive abundance and result in pest problems similar to those occurring on Kangaroo Island and in parts of Victoria.<br/><br/>The overall distribution of Koalas has been reduced since European settlement. This decline was primarily due to disease, bushfires, and widespread habitat destruction in the early decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Commercial harvesting also took place across the range towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century (large numbers, running into the millions, were killed for their pelts for a large export industry in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland). This was banned in Victoria in the 1890s, and it continued sporadically (and under regulation) in Queensland until 1927 (Hrdina and Gordon 2004). There is no evidence, however, that the early spate of commercial harvesting had any long-term impact on the overall population.&#160;Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species&#160;(Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012).","There are robust population estimates for some regions, notably the Mulga Lands of southwest Queensland (for which a 2009 estimate is about 12,000 individuals: Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011). More broadly, Queensland EPA (2006) estimated the Koala population size in Queensland in 2006 at between 100,000 and 300,000 individuals. In its 2012 listing advice, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012) provided State-based ‘best estimates’ of population size in 2010, tallying to between 347,000 and 518,000 individuals across all States. Some other sources have concluded that the population size is &lt;100,000 individuals (see The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee 2011). A recent expert-based elicitation process provided an aggregated mean estimate of 330,000 individuals across the Koala’s current range (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012), suggesting the number of mature individuals is <em>c</em>. 300,000.<br/><br/>Population densities are very variable between regions and across time: examples include 1-3 individuals/ha in coastal forests in south-eastern Queensland (Queensland EPA 2006), 0.01/ha in central Queensland (Melzer <em>et al</em>. 2000), 0.006/ha in coastal forests of south-eastern New South Wales (Jurskis and Potter 1997), and &gt;5/ha in forests on Kangaroo Island prior to population control (Masters <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Koala subpopulations may show marked fluctuation, with severe crashes associated with over-browsing (Menkhorst 2004, 2008) and with long periods of low rainfall or episodes of very high temperatures (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1988, Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Gordon <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered the overall direction for population trend for Koalas to be unknown. However, the evidence for overall reduction in population size over the past three generations is compelling, given sustained management to reduce or stabilize population density of the largest South Australian subpopulation, demonstration of major decline in parts of inland Queensland (notably in the Mulga Lands, where population size decreased over recent decades by 80%: Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011), and in much of the coastal range of south-eastern Queensland (e.g. 68% decline in the ‘Koala Coast’ region from 1999 to 2010) and New South Wales. However, trends in these regions are not necessarily typical of the broader range, and population trends may also vary between different subpopulations within regions: for example, while most monitored Queensland subpopulations have experienced decline over the last two decades, a low density population at Oakey on the eastern Darling Downs has shown relative stability in population size (McAlpine <em>et al</em>. 2012; G. Gordon pers. comm. 2014). Likewise, in New South Wales, subpopulations in coastal regions have declined (some, including around Eden and Iluka, to extirpation or nearly so), but there are several subpopulations (including Lismore, Campbelltown and Southern Highlands) that are relatively stable.<br/><br/>Regional-level population size and trend estimates were collated by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (2012), based on information from sites with known population density information (or estimates of number of individuals in subpopulations) and monitoring results, extrapolated to regional scale, and summed over regions, with some sensitivity analysis. These estimates indicate a 20-year (1990-2010) decline in population size nationally of about 28%, with that decline greatest in low rainfall areas of western Queensland exposed to drought conditions. A summary of their interpretation of population status and trends is given in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material. The major uncertainties in these estimates of population trends arise from the wide range of estimates for the size of the Victorian subpopulations, and to the imprecision of extrapolations of limited site-specific data to broader regional trends.<br/>&#160;<br/>A separate and subsequent independent assessment of population size and trends was provided by McAlpine <em>et al</em>. (2012), based on an expert elicitation process (e.g. McBride <em>et al</em>. 2012) involving 15 experts in Koala ecology and management across the Koala’s range. Although some state-based population size estimates differed from those given by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, this process reported a remarkably similar estimate of overall decline in population size of 28.6% in three generational periods (over a ‘sliding time window of the past three generations and the future three generations of koala (15-21 years)’), although with very wide bounds around the relevant population size and trend estimates (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). These wide bounds are indicative of substantial disagreements between experts concerning population size and trends, and the sparse and not necessarily representative monitoring data for some subpopulations. Note also that McAlpine <em>et al</em>. (2012) used a 5-7 year period for generational length, in contrast to the 6-8 year period reported by Phillips (2000).<br/><br/>With respect to eligibility against IUCN criteria, it could be argued that the decline over the last three generations has been driven mainly by the impacts of a severe drought, that has now ceased, and hence that the relevant criterion is A1, for which a decline of &gt;50% in the relevant 20 year time frame would be required for eligibility. However, drought has been only one of many factors driving decline across the Koala’s range. Furthermore, the ability of inland Koala populations to recover from this recent drought is likely to be severely compromised by widespread tree death and the legacy impacts of vegetation clearance which will constrain options for repopulation of now fragmented habitat (Seabrook <em>et al</em>. 2011; Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012). Other threats will continue to cause broad-scale population decline across much of the Koala’s range, and the impacts of at least some of these threats may be expected to be exacerbated by climate change (Adams-Hosking <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b, 2012).",Decreasing,"The Koala was formerly common throughout the broad band of forests and woodlands dominated by <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp. extending from north Queensland to the south-eastern corner of mainland South Australia, Australia (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). Currently it occurs in northeastern, central, and southeastern Queensland with patchy populations in western areas; eastern New South Wales including the coastal strip and highlands of the Great Dividing Range, as well as the western plains and related riparian environments where suitable habitat occurs; Victoria; and southeastern South Australia. Its total geographic range has contracted significantly due to loss of large areas of habitat since European settlement. In Queensland, extent of occurrence and area of occupancy have contracted by about 30% (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>The Koala has been introduced to at least 12 islands including: Kangaroo (South Australia, 450,000 ha), French (Victoria, 17,470 ha), Phillip (Victoria, 10,116 ha), and Magnetic (Queensland, 5,200 ha) (Abbott and Burbidge 1995). It has also been introduced within the mainland in the Adelaide Region and along the Murray River (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996).","Formerly Koala subpopulations were severely depleted by hunting (for furs), with millions killed. This hunting continued up to 1927 in Queensland (Hrdina and Gordon 2004, Gordon and Hrdina 2005, Gordon <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Terrestrial,"<p>There is no national recovery plan; however there is a national conservation and management strategy (NRMMC 2009), a recovery plan for the Koala in New South Wales (NSW DECC 2008), a management strategy in Victoria (Menkhorst 2004), and a conservation plan and management program for the Koala in Queensland (Queensland EPA 2006).<br/><br/>A recent parliamentary inquiry concluded that the national conservation and management strategy was largely ineffective (The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee 2011).<br/><br/>In part because of its iconic status, there has been a relatively long history of conservation management directed specifically at the Koala (e.g. Menkhorst 2004, 2008; Queensland EPA 2006; New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change 2008; Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council 2010). This has included a substantial history of translocations, including conservation marooning and re-introduction (mostly in Victoria, Menkhorst 2008) and introduction (mostly in South Australia: Masters <em>et al</em>. 2004), some land management and forestry prescriptions, monitoring, substantial research, and localized management of some threats.

It occurs in a range of forest types, including warm temperate rainforests, wet eucalypt forests and shrubby dry forests, particularly where there is a dense understorey, a mixed-species overstorey and moist friable soils (Seebeck <em>et al</em>. 1989; Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000). It has been recorded from 100 to 1,400 m a.s.l. (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000; Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009). Long-footed Potoroos are probably territorial, with home range size varying from 14-60 hectares, larger in males than females (Green <em>et al</em>. 1998). Underground-fruiting fungi comprise the vast bulk of its diet, with some invertebrates and plant material also eaten (Green <em>et al</em>. 1999). Like other species of Potoroidae that feed on hypogeal fungi, the Long-footed Potoroos provides ecosystem services consisting of improving soil condition by digging through and turning over soil, and dispersing the spores of the ectomycorrhizal fungi on which it feeds, thereby benefitting plants by promoting mycorrhizal symbiosis. The abundance and diversity of fungi is affected by season and rainfall, fire regimes, logging and other disturbances (Claridge <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>The Long-footed Potoroo is probably monogamous (Scotts and Seebeck 1989). Breeding may occur throughout the year, although births (of a single young) may peak in late winter and early spring (Green and Mitchell 1997).</p>","Major threats to the species include predation from foxes, dingoes, and feral dogs, which may lead to the low densities at which this species has been found (Menkhorst and Seebeck 2008). Introduced pigs might be competitors for this species' specialized food requirements. Inappropriate fire regimes might also affect the fungi on which this species depends. Logging activities appear to be detrimental to the species, but further research is required for confirmation (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2002).","<p>There has been no robust estimate of the population size of this species, nor that of any of its subpopulations. Currently, population estimation is constrained by the difficulty of detecting the species, and the localized scale at which it is mostly being studied. It is generally accepted to be ‘rare’ (McKnight 2008). The total population size ‘seems unlikely to … exceed a few thousand individuals, and may be no more than a few hundred’ (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000; McKnight 2008).<br/><br/>Given the limited information on population size and historical distribution, the population trend is unknown (McKnight 2008), although is probably declining due to current fire regimes, predation and other factors. Although this information cannot be used to define population trends, an unprecedented number of roadkills has been reported recently in far eastern Gippsland in an area now subjected to intensive fox baiting under the recently established Southern Ark program, with 11 records in a 23 month period to November 2012, compared with fewer than five across the previous 20 years (A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Long-footed Potoroo is restricted to mainland south-eastern Australia, where it is currently known from three small disjunct areas. In near-coastal East Gippsland it has been recorded from more than 60 separate sites (‘sites include clusters of records’: Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009) within an area of <em>c</em>. 1600 km<sup>2</sup>. More recent (post 2008) records from road-kills and camera trapping, including at Cape Conran and west of the Snowy River, increase this known range (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009; A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). An inland subpopulation in the Great Dividing Range of north-eastern Victoria (around the Barry Ranges and the headwaters of the Wonnangatta, Buffalo, Buckland and Ovens Rivers) is known from more than 60 sites within an area of more than 3000 km<sup>2</sup> (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009). The third subpopulation occurs in far south-eastern New South Wales, including the South-East Forests National Park and Bondi, Nungatta and Yambulla State Forests, within an area of 200 km<sup>2</sup> (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000). Within these three broad locations (totalling 4,800 km<sup>2</sup>), Long-footed Potoroos are likely to occur in ‘only a relatively small proportion of the area’ (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009).<br/><br/>Reflecting its recent discovery, the difficulty of detecting the species, and continuing targeted searching, the known range of the Long-footed Potoroo has increased over the last 20-30 years. However, this increase simply reflects more knowledge rather than range expansion, and the extent to which its actual range may have changed historically or in recent decades is unknown. Some limited fossil records, a 1900 specimen from near Rosedale (to the west of its current known range), and some clearing and intensive forestry activities in and around parts of its known range suggest that its actual range has probably declined slightly since European settlement.</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p>A Recovery Plan for this species was developed in 2000 (Nunan <em>et al</em>. 2000). An Action Statement, consistent with the Recovery Plan, was implemented in Victoria (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009), and a Research Plan (Broome <em>et al</em>. 1997) and Recovery Plan (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2002) was implemented in New South Wales.&#160;Most of the actions in these Plans have been implemented, mostly successfully . Surveys have substantially extended the known range. Broad-scale fox management, under the Southern Ark program, appears to have been instrumental in stabilizing if not increasing the population size in at least some areas (A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. in Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Since its relatively recent discovery, the Long-footed Potoroo has been subject to specific protection measures, with exclusion of forestry activities and intensive baiting of introduced predators (targeting foxes) around known localities in Victoria. In New South Wales, much of the known range of the species now occurs within the boundaries of conservation reserves, so ongoing forestry activities are not an issue. Ongoing 1080 baiting of introduced predators is also a high priority management action in that State. Across the Australia-wide distribution of the species there has been significant survey effort as well as some ecological research.<br/><br/>&#160;A captive population was maintained for several years at Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria, but was not viable in the long-term due to lack of replenishment over time and poor breeding success (Department of Sustainability and Environment 2009).</p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

However, an overall decline in population size is inferred and projected, at a rate approaching but not &gt;30% over 9-12 years (=three generations). The causes of this are increasing intensity of destructive wildfires within the species range, effects of habitat fragmentation, and continuing impacts of invasive predators, especially the Red Fox. The Long-nosed Potoroo is therefore listed as Near Threatened as it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A2ce.<br/><br/>Population size cannot be estimated reliably. Population trends vary across the range, with general pattern of decline (particularly for the northern subspecies) but some local increases evident in areas subjected to effective control of the Red Fox.","<p>The Long-nosed Potoroo occurs in a range of vegetation types characterized by dense understoreys, including shrublands, coastal scrub, heathlands, forest and woodlands, and rainforests (Seebeck <em>et al</em>. 1989; Johnston 2008; Norton <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is often most likely to occur near creeks or gullies. Optimal habitat often includes a mosaic of different vegetation types, with denser vegetation used for shelter and more open areas for foraging (Seebeck 1981; Bennett 1993; Norton <em>et al</em>. 2010). Hypogeal (underground-fruiting) fungi comprise most of the diet (Claridge <em>et al</em>. 1993). The species provides significant ecosystem services through its foraging for hypogea fungi, in two ways. First, digging for fungi produces substantial turnover of soil, which improves soil condition and water infiltration (Fleming <em>et al.</em> 2014). Second, the Long-nosed Potoroo disperses spores of these fungi in its faeces. Because these fungi are mycorrhizal, feeding by the Potoroo promotes formation of mycorrhiza and benefits many plant species (Claridge <em>et al. </em>1992). The diet also includes some invertebrates, fruits, seeds, leaves, roots, and flowers (Bennett and Baxter 1989).<br/><br/>Long-nosed Potoroos are mostly solitary. Home range size is 1-19 ha, with home ranges larger in males than females (Kitchener 1973; Long 2001). The species shows limited dispersal ability (A. Murray <em>pers. comm</em>. 2014). Reproduction occurs year-round, with a single young produced at a time (Guiler 1960; Bryant 1989; Norton <em>et al</em>. 2011; Frankham <em>et al</em>. 2011). Females typically produce 2-3 young per year (Bennett 1987; Seebeck <em>et al</em>. 1989). Sexual maturity is reached at one year (Bennett 1987; Bryant 1989), and longevity can be at least seven years (Guiler and Kitchener 1967) but is more generally four to five years (Martin and Temple-Smith 2012). Generation length is around three years.</p>","The major threat is predation, especially by the invasive Red Fox (Brown and Triggs 1990; Lunney <em>et al</em>. 1990, 2002; Short 1998; Martin and Temple-Smith 2012), but also by wild dogs and feral cats. Habitat quality is affected by clearing and fragmentation, fires that are too frequent or too intense, livestock, and timber harvesting&#160;(Bennett 1993;&#160;Norton <em>et al</em>. 2011;&#160;Martin and Temple-Smith 2012).","On the mainland, the Long-nosed Potoroo is rare, and populations are extremely fragmented; the species may undergo fluctuations in numbers. It is also rare on the Bass Straits islands but is more common in Tasmania (Johnston 2008). Subfossil remains suggest that the species was formerly more widespread. The reasons for decline are unclear, however, habitat loss through clearance of native vegetation is likely to have at least partly caused a decline in populations (Johnston 2008). The species is susceptible to effects of forest fragmentation, being rarely found in forest patches smaller than approximately 30 ha (Bennett 1990).<br/><br/>There has been no robust estimate of the population size of this species, nor that of most subpopulations. However, this species usually occurs in small populations with low recruitment and low turnover of individuals (Bennett 1987).

The species is particularly susceptible because of slow life history characteristics, specialist requirements for large tree hollows (and hence mature forests), and relatively specialised dietary requirements. Across its broad range, the population size and rate of decline is unknown, but a large-scale monitoring program in the central highlands of Victoria demonstrated a decline of <em>c</em>. 9% per year for the period 1997-2010; and a substantial monitoring program in a conservation reserve in coastal New South Wales reported a complete loss of the monitored subpopulation over the period 2002 to 2010 (Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 2011). At woodland sites in central Queensland first sampled in 1973-76 and re-sampled in 2001-02, abundance declined by 89% (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2006). There is little other published information on population trends over the period relevant to this assessment (<em>c</em>. 22 years), and these sites are not necessarily representative of trends across the species’ range, but they provide sufficient evidence to suspect that the overall rate of population decline exceeds 30% over a 22 year (=three generation) period.","<p>The Greater Glider is an arboreal marsupial, largely restricted to eucalypt forests and woodlands. It is primarily folivorous, with a diet mostly comprising eucalypt leaves, and occasionally flowers (Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Kavanagh and Lambert 1990; van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2004). Highest abundance is typically in taller, montane, moist eucalypt forests, with relatively old trees and abundant hollows (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994; Smith <em>et al</em>. 1994a,b; Kavanagh 2000; Eyre 2004; van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2004; Vanderduys <em>et al</em>. 2012). The distribution may be patchy even in suitable habitat (Kavanagh 2000). The Greater Glider favours forests with a diversity of eucalypt species, due to seasonal variation in preference for food tree species (Kavanagh 1984).<br/><br/>During the day it shelters in tree hollows, with a particular selection for large hollows in large, old trees (Henry 1984; Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 1991; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007; Goldingay 2012). In Grafton/Casino, Urbenville and Urunga/Coffs Harbour Forestry Management Areas (FMAs) in northern New South Wales, the abundance of Greater Gliders on survey sites was significantly greater on sites with a higher abundance of tree hollows (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994; Smith <em>et al</em>. 1994a,b). In the Grafton/Casino FMA, the Greater Glider was absent from surveyed sites with fewer than six tree hollows per hectare (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1994a). In southern Queensland, Greater Gliders need at least 2-4 live den trees for every 2 ha of suitable forest habitat (Eyre 2002).<br/><br/>Home ranges are typically relatively small (1-4 ha: Henry 1984; Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Comport <em>et al</em>. 1996; Gibbons and Lindenmayer 2002; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005), but are larger in lower productivity forests and more open woodlands (to 16 ha: Eyre 2004; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007), and larger for males than for females (Kavanagh and Wheeler 2004; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005), with male home ranges being largely non-overlapping (Henry 1984; Kavanagh and Wheeler 2004; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The Greater Glider is considered to be particularly sensitive to forest clearance (Tyndale-Biscoe and Smith 1969a), and to intensive logging (Kavanagh and Bamkin 1995; Kavanagh and Webb 1998; Kavanagh and Wheeler 2004; Kavanagh <em>et al</em>. 1995), although responses vary according to landscape context and the extent of tree removal and retention (Kavanagh 2000; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The Greater Glider is also sensitive to wildfire (Lunney 1987; Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994; Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. 2011), and slow to recover following major disturbance (Kavanagh 2004). In Urbenville FMA of northern New South Wales, the abundance of Greater Gliders on survey sites was significantly greater in forests that were infrequently burnt (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Notwithstanding relatively small home ranges, but in part because of low dispersal ability, Greater Gilders may be sensitive to fragmentation (Eyre 2006; McCarthy and Lindenmayer 1999ab; Lindenmayer et al. 2000; Taylor and Goldingay 2009), have relatively low persistence in small forest fragments, and disperse poorly across vegetation that is not native forest. Modelling suggests that they need native forest patches of at least 160 km<sup>2</sup> to maintain viable populations (Eyre 2002).<br/><br/>Females give birth to a single young, from March to June (Tyndale-Biscoe and Smith 1969b; McKay 2008). Sexual maturity is reached in the second year (Tyndale-Biscoe and Smith 1969b). Longevity has been estimated at 15 years (Harris and Maloney 2010), so generation length is 7-8 years. The relatively low reproductive rate (Henry 1984) may render small isolated populations in small remnants prone to extinction (van der Ree 2004; Pope <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>","Land clearing for agriculture, logging, and bushfires adversely affects this species throughout its range, with these threats exacerbated because of need for large trees with hollows and very limited dispersal. Modelling indicates severe range contraction for northern subspecies (Kearney <em>et al</em>. 2010)","<p>There is no reliable estimate of population size. Lunney <em>et al</em>. (2008) considered that it had a ‘presumed large population’ and was ‘locally common’. Winter <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered it ‘common’ in the north Queensland portion of its range. In New South Wales, Kavanagh (2004) considered it ‘widespread and common … particularly in north-eastern New South Wales’. Density estimates in Victoria range from 0.6 to 2.8 individuals/ha (Henry 1984; van der Ree <em>et al</em>. 2004), and across its broader range from 0.01 to 5 individuals/ha (Kavanagh 1984; Kehl and Borsboom 1984; Maloney 2007). In southern Queensland, trees with hollows are extremely limited in some extensive forest types that have been historically used for timber production, and this in turn limits Greater Glider distribution and abundance (Eyre 2006).<br/><br/>Lunney <em>et al</em>. (2008) stated that the population was decreasing. Maloney (2007) described the loss of one isolated population (at Royal National Park) due to fire, and regional-scale decline (in the Illawarra area).<br/><br/>Lindenmayer <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported results from two substantial monitoring programs, in the central highlands of Victoria and at Jervis Bay. Over the period 1997 to 2010, the Greater Glider declined by an average of 8.8% per year in the central highlands sites (i.e. a rate that if extrapolated over the 22 year period relevant to this assessment is 87%), with higher rates of decline in forests subject to logging than in conservation reserves, and with losses (to 2010) of Greater Gliders at all sites burnt by a major wildfire in 2009. At the Jervis Bay (Booderee National Park) site, the Greater Glider was recorded from 22 of 110 sampled sites in 2002, but has not been recorded at all in repeated surveys at those sites since 2007.<br/><br/>In central Queensland, the abundance of Greater Gliders declined by 89% across a series of 31 woodland sites sampled initially in 1973-76 and then re-sampled in 2001-02 (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>",Decreasing,"The Greater Glider is endemic to eastern Australia, where it ranges from Windsor Tableland in far northern Queensland to the Wombat Forest in central Victoria.

Fragmentation of subpopulations is increased by the impacts of predation by red foxes, which restricts quokkas to patches of dense vegetation and inhibits dispersal between patches. Many surviving subpopulations may therefore not be viable over the long term, and the original metapopulation structure has collapsed. Significant projected loss of extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) due to climate change, mainly a continuing reduction in winter rainfall, has been predicted","<p>In the northern jarrah forest, Quokkas are closely associated with tea-tree <em>Taxandria linearifolia</em> swamps with a mosaic of trees at differing ages as determined by fire (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007, de Tores 2008). In the southern jarrah forest, Quokkas occupy a wider variety of forest, woodland and wetland types including Jarrah <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>, Marri <em>Corymbia calophylla</em>, Karri <em>E. diversicolor</em> and Tingle <em>E. jacksonii</em> or <em>E. guilfoylei</em>, and sedge-dominated riparian habitats (K. Bain <em>pers. comm</em>. 2008). Family groups exhibit overlapping home ranges that reflect a general non-territoriality. In the northern jarrah forest, Quokkas require a mosaic of habitat, including recently-burnt and long-unburnt <em>Taxandria</em> stands, and they do not utilize stands burnt 15-19 years previously (Christensen and Kimber 1975, de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2007). As swamps mature they become suboptimal, forcing Quokkas to colonise new patches. Since the collapse of the metapopulation following the arrival of the Red Fox in the 1930s, Quokkas have been forced to remain at a site because predation inhibits dispersal (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2005a).</p>    <p>de Tores <em>et al</em>. (2004) reviewed Quokka research and conservation to that date. They noted, so far as the northern jarrah forest subpopulations are concerned, that despite six years of fox baiting, Quokka populations in the northern jarrah forest had not shown a pattern of increase (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2003). However, a recent study has shown recovery of subpopulations in the northern jarrah forest after some years of fox baiting (Dundas <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>    <p>Quokkas occur as many small, isolated subpopulations, many of which are within State forest subject to multiple use including timber harvesting. They remain in such areas despite more than 100 years of logging, but the effects of such disturbance are poorly understood. The Department of Environment and Conservation has developed adaptive management guidelines for management of such areas (Burrows and Liddlelow 2005) and validation of rapid assessment techniques has recently been completed. Along the south coast, Quokkas inhabit swamps, riparian areas, incised gullies and dense heaths. On Rottnest Island, they are found in all vegetation types, sheltering in low scrub (Nicholls 1971; Kitchener 1972, 1982). The biology of Rottnest Island Quokkas has been widely studied (Bradshaw 1983). On Bald Island Quokkas are widespread.</p>","Island populations fluctuate, but appear stable over the long term. Predation by red foxes and possibly feral cats has led to a past decline of mainland populations. Fox control has led to an increase in numbers in some areas. Feral pigs are causing habitat degradation and excluding Quokkas from swampy areas. Inappropriate fire regimes can lead to habitat degradation. Climate change leading to less rainfall is a current minor problem but is predicted to become severe.","<p>There are no robust estimates of overall abundance; de Tores <em>et al</em>. (2008) suggested that there may be <em>ca</em> 3,500-7,000 individuals on the mainland, 1,200-2,000 of which are along the south coast. It is abundant on Rottnest Island (4,000-8,000 individuals; Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2003) and Bald Island (500-2,000; de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2008). Many mainland subpopulations are thought to consist of only a few individuals (Alecs <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sinclair and Morris 1996). Is population size has declined substantially since European settlement, and is still declining.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Quokka is endemic to south-western Australia, including Rottnest (17 km²) and Bald (8 km²) Islands and, formerly, Breaksea Island (1 km², Abbott 2006). It was originally distributed from Moore River, 100 km north of Perth, through the higher rainfall part of the south-west, east along the south coast to at least the Green Range, 60 km north-east of Albany. Fossil deposits and historical records suggest that the Quokka originally occupied an area of approximately 41 200 km² in the south-western corner of Australia (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2007). </p>    <p>Historical literature has shown that they were widespread and abundant when Europeans colonised the region in 1829, but a noticeable and dramatic decline occurred over the following century (Hayward 2002). This can be attributed mainly to the arrival of the Red Fox in the 1930s (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2005a) and land clearing. There was another major contraction in the period 1980 to 1992, the cause of which is unknown, but it could be related to habitat deterioration, fox predation and declining winter rainfall. Overall range has contracted southwards with the northernmost records now in the Darling Range immediately east and north-east of Perth. The current extent of occurrence (EOO) was estimated as <em>ca</em> 17&#160;800&#160;km² by de Tores <em>et al</em>. (2007), but our calculation, using records since 1992 and including Rottnest Island, suggests it is larger than this. It persists patchily along the south coast east to the Green Range, including an isolated subpopulation in Stirling Range National Park. Quokkas are thought to be now absent from the Swan Coastal Plain, except for a recent record at Muddy Lakes, near Bunbury (Sinclair and Hyder 2009), although there have been two additional unconfirmed recent reports of presence (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2007). Remaining subpopulations throughout much of current range are small and often isolated in the best habitat. They are severely fragmented because Red Fox predation greatly limits gene flow between mainland subpopulations. The area of occupancy (AOO) is thought to have been reduced by around 50% over the past century (de Tores <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p>A recovery plan has been prepared recently (DEC 2013).

170619657,41291,Oryctolagus cuniculus,Endangered,A2abce,2019,2018-08-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The European Rabbit is a widespread colonizer and is considered a pest  outside its natural range, where eradication of the rabbit is priority  for conservation (Cooke 2014, Cooke, Flux and Bonino 2018). However,  only the natural range of Spain, Portugal, and southern France are  considered in this global assessment. Assessment of the European Rabbit  is filled with contradictions (Lees and Bell 2008, Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em>  2011). The European Rabbit is an important game species in Spain,  Portugal and France, and the agriculture sector considers the species a  pest (not a typical situation for a putatively Threatened species). On  the other hand, it is an important ecosystem engineer (Galvez-Bravo <em>et al.</em> 2009) and a keystone species within its native range (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em>  2008), serving as the dominant prey item for the highly endangered  Iberian Lynx (<em>Lynx pardinus</em>) and the Spanish Imperial Eagle (<em>Aquila  adalberti</em>) (Ferrer and Negro 2004). However, from 1950 onwards, the  European Rabbit declined dramatically throughout its native range to  densities less than 10% of those found earlier in the 20th century  mainly due to the irruption of viral diseases (Myxomatosis in the  fifties and Rabbit Hemorrhagic disease, RHD, in the nineties), and  habitat loss (Moreno <em>et al.</em> 2007, Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2009a, Villafuerte <em>et al.</em>  2017). Other factors such as human induced mortality or predation may  have played a role in rabbit decline, at least locally. On balance this  situation led more than one decade ago to a classification of the  European Rabbit as Vulnerable in Spain and Near Threatened in Portugal  (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005, Villafuerte and Delibes-Mateos 2008). In  recent years many rabbit populations, particularly in natural habitats,  have continued declining (some have even become extirpated), while  others, mostly in human-modified landscapes, have increased in numbers  leading to an increase in complaints by farmers concerning crop damage  caused by rabbits (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2014a).<br/><br/>Most  recently, beginning after 2010, a new wave of disease (a new variant of  RHD virus – GI.2/RHDV2/b) has swept through many rabbit populations  causing massive declines. In an area that traditionally held the highest  rabbit densities within Doñana National Park (i.e. Coto del Rey) –  which thus held a core population of Iberian Lynx – there was a decline  of greater than 80% during 2012-2014. In low-density rabbit areas within  the park similar declines have been reported (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em>  2014b). Rabbit density in the proximity to Yeguas River in Andújar and  Cardeña Natural park in southern Spain, where the largest Iberian Lynx  population lives, the rabbit density declined from more than 3.5  rabbits/ha in 2010 to less than 1 rabbit/ha in 2013 (a decline of  approximately 75%). Also, rabbit abundance decreased by 57% between 2010  and 2014 in 26 localities surveyed in the Córdoba province (southern  Spain), only 11% of these populations experienced a positive trend in  the study period (Guerrero-Casado <em>et al.</em> 2016). The Andalusian  government through censuses that started in 2004, has shown that rabbit  density has decreased on average by more than 50% in 2016, despite the  increase in abundance detected in some agricultural areas, where rabbits  have to be controlled to avoid crop damage (www.juntadeandalucia.es).  Hunters have similarly noted the decreased abundance of rabbits based on  declines of 70-80% in the hunter bags in some estates compared with  recent years (Delibes-Mateos <em>et al.</em> 2014b). In summary, the  recent overall estimated 60-70% decline in populations of European  Rabbits over the past decade has been followed by decreases of 65.7% in  Iberian Lynx and 45.5% in Spanish Imperial Eagle fecundities (Monterroso  <em>et al.</em> 2016). These new data lead to a re-evaluation of the  previous assessment of the European Rabbit as NT, to EN – Endangered A2abce reflecting that populations have experienced or are  experiencing declines mainly due to the recent impact of GI.2/RHDV2/b.  The A3 criteria has not been applied because European Rabbits have been  known to develop immunity to epizootics of prior viral diseases, it is  hoped that a similar recovery will occur following this epizootic.","The European Rabbit prefers a mixed habitat of Mediterranean oak savanna  or scrub-forest, or areas with around 40% cover for shelter from  predators and open areas that support their diet of grasses and cereals  (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995, Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).  Nevertheless, in the Iberian Peninsula, rabbits are increasingly found  at high densities in intensively-managed farmland areas (Barrio <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). The European Rabbit builds warrens in soft soil (Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2004), but finds shelter in scrub in rocky areas, though predation risk  is higher in above ground dwellings (Villafuerte and Moreno 1997). The  natural range of the European Rabbit on the Iberian Peninsula is warm  and dry, rarely occurring above 1,500 m (Fa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999). The rabbits are territorial and tend to live and forage in colony groups of up to 20 adults (Mitchell-Jones <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999), and are crepuscular (Lombardi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>The  European Rabbit can breed throughout the year (uncommon in lagomorphs),  though this is limited by climate and resource availability (Bell and  Webb 1991, Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). They raise altricial  young between three and six at a time, which leave the warren in under a  month (Gibb 1990). Females reach sexual maturity on average in 3.5  months, males in 4 months, and can live up to 9 years (Macdonald and  Barrett 2001), though many succumb to predation and other perils much  earlier. Up to 75% of young rabbits are killed by predators before they  establish a territory (Gibb 1990). Annual mortality is usually higher  than 50% (e.g. Cowan 1983, Webb 1991), but it can be highly variable  among years, seasons, and habitats (Lombardi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Moreno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). The head-body length is 34-50 mm (Macdonald and Barrett 2001).<br/><br/>The European Rabbit is an ecosystem engineer and a keystone species (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Galvez-Bravo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). The diet of the Iberian Lynx consists of 80-100% rabbits (Delibes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000), the Imperial Eagle consumes 40-80% of its diet in rabbits (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2008), and the decline of the European Rabbit has been linked to the  near extinction of these two predators (Ferrer and Negro 2004).<br/><br/>The  European Rabbit is responsible for landscape modelling that supports  vegetation growth typical to Spain and Portugal and creates habitat for  wildlife species (e.g. Galvez-Bravo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Its presence increases species richness (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and increases soil fertility (Willott <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).","The greatest force behind the decline of the European Rabbit has been  two diseases that appeared in the 20th century. Myxomatosis is a South  American virus, primarily spread by insect (mosquito and flea) vectors,  that was intentionally introduced by a farmer in the mid-1950s in France  to control the rabbit population (Lavazza and Cooke 2018). An estimated  90% of European Rabbits perished due to myxomatosis after the first  outbreaks in the 1950s (Muñoz 1960), after that, the disease became  endemic to Iberia, where it currently affects most rabbit populations  (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). After symptom onset, death  results in an average of 13 days. Rabbits with the virus are made more  vulnerable to predators (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995) and more susceptible to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD; Barnett <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018). Juveniles are more susceptible to myxomatosis than adults (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Myxomatosis cases peak during early summer to fall (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).<br/><br/>Rabbit  Haemorrhagic Disease is caused by a lagovirus that appeared in Europe  in the late 1980’s, initially causing the death of 55-75% of rabbits in  the Iberian Peninsula (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). RHD is  primarily spread by direct contact. Death typically results within 24  hours of symptom onset, with a short incubation time of under 48 hours  (Villafuerte <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Adult rabbits are more  susceptible to RHD than juveniles (unlike myxomatosis), and RHD is more  prevalent in late winter and spring. Global warming may increase disease  incidence by creating a warmer, drier climate in Spain and Portugal  (Ward 2005).<br/><br/>The new variant of RHD (GI.2/RHD2/b) was originally  described in France in 2010, and since 2011-2012 it has caused  wide-spread mortality among European Rabbits in Spain (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b) and Portugal (Monterroso <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Declines of from 75% - 80% within two years have decimated many  populations of European Rabbits – particularly in their native habitat,  which coincides with core habitat occupied by Iberian Lynx  (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 20014b, Monterroso <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). The new variant has fully replaced classic RHD strains in Spain and Portugal (Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Lopes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Unlike classic RHD, the new variant kills young rabbits (Dalton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Abrantes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), compromising population recruitment.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and fragmentation are continuing to cause declines in European Rabbits (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010), which require pastures-crops and scrub- forest vegetation for  food and shelter, respectively (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995). Modern  intensive agriculture negatively impacts rabbits more than small scale  mixed farming, which may have initially increased suitable habitat  within the rabbit’s natural range (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010). High intensity livestock production and high ungulate numbers  contributes to habitat degradation and resource competition (Carpio <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2014). Fallow farm land often returns to closed forest rather than open  scrub, which is not a suitable habitat (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995,  Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). Tree plantations planted in Spain  and Portugal have replaced habitat for both rabbits and their predators  and urbanization presents a threat as does increased fire danger in  existing habitat, and climate change (Ward 2005, Tablado and Revilla  2012).<br/><br/>Exploitation of European Rabbis by humans may have become a  threat in some places, especially in the case of populations that are  already declining due to other causes, so rabbits cannot sustain hunting  and control measures as well as in the past. As an example, in Aragón  (northeastern Spain) the strongest negative rabbit population trends  were found in areas with high hunting pressure (Williams <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Farmers and hunters control rabbit populations in farmland areas directly by shooting and trapping (Ríos-Saldaña <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010). Farming indirectly causes decline through habitat conversion and  excessive pesticide and fertilizer use. Over 70% of Spain is designated  as hunting area, and in recent years some hunters have reported a 70% -  80% decline in hunting success due to lower rabbit populations  resulting from the new variant of RHDv (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b).<br/><br/>Future  threats to the European Rabbit may include genetically modified  versions of the rabbit viruses being developed in Australia to reduce  rabbit numbers where the species is a major pest. Unlicensed release of  modified viruses to the native range could devastate the remaining  populations (Angulo 2001). Finally. the mixture of both subspecies due  the restocking of rabbits for hunting or predator conservation purposes,  may also become a threat by losing the natural genetic diversity  compromising the survival and reproduction in the wild (Piorno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).","The European Rabbit decline has escalated in recent years. As of 2005,  rabbit populations in the Iberian Peninsula had declined to as little as  5-10% of the number from 1950, based on the decrease in Doñana National  Park, a protected area (Delibes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Moreno <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2007). Density of rabbits has been recorded at a maximum of 40 per  hectare in prime habitat, though the abundance has declined  significantly since the arrival of new threats, primarily the spread of  viral diseases (myxomatosis and RHD), in the mid-20th century  (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009a, Villafuerte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2017). In Portugal, a population reduction of 24% was recorded between  1995 and 2002 (Alves and Ferreira 2002), but this decline was much more  pronounced previously as a consequence of myxomatosis and RHD outbreaks  in the 1950s and late 1980s, respectively. Decline has been uneven  across the range, due to varying degrees of threat (Ward 2005,  Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009a).<br/><br/>Most recently,  beginning in 2011-2012, a new wave of disease (a new variant of Rabbit  Hemorrhagic Disease virus – GI.2/RHDV2/b) has swept through many rabbit  populations causing massive declines. This variant has completely  replaced the traditional RHDv strain across Iberia (Calvete <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Lopes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2015), and its drastic effects are evident. In an area that  traditionally held the highest rabbit densities within Doñana National  Park (i.e. Coto del Rey) – which thus held a core population of Iberian  Lynx – there was a decline of greater than 80% during 2012-2014. In  low-density rabbit areas within the park similar declines have been  reported (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). Rabbit  density in the proximity to Yeguas River in Andújar and Cardeña National  parks in southern Spain, where the largest Iberian Lynx population  lives, the rabbit density declined from more than 3.5 rabbits/ha in 2010  to less than 1 rabbit/ha in 2013 (a decline of approximately 75%).  Hunters have similarly noted the decreased abundance of rabbits based on  declines of 70-80% in the hunter bags in some estates compared with  recent years (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). Also,  rabbit abundance decreased by 57% between 2010 and 2014 in 26 localities  surveyed in the Córdoba province (southern Spain), only 11% of these  populations experienced a positive trend during the study period  (Guerrero-Casado <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016). The recent overall  estimated 60-70% decline in populations of European Rabbits has been  followed by decreases of 65.7% in Iberian Lynx and 45.5% in Spanish  Imperial Eagle fecundities (Monterroso <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2016).",Decreasing,"Original distribution of the European Rabbit after last ice age included Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) to south-western France and perhaps northern Africa, and the introduction throughout western Europe is thought to have occurred as early as the Roman period (Gibb 1990, Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999). Currently the species ranges through all Western European countries, Ireland and the UK (including islands), Austria, parts of Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, and Mediterranean islands Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Crete, the Balearics (Thompson and King 1994), Croatia, and Slovakia (Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999). It was introduced to Australia and New Zealand, where it is now widespread (Thompson and King 1994, Cooke 2014, Cooke <em>et al. </em>2018). European Rabbits have been introduced to South America multiple times since the fifteenth century, but the species maintains a limited range in Argentina and Chile (Delibes and Delibes-Mateos 2015). European Rabbits have similarly been introduced on over 800 islands throughout the world, giving evidence to the plasticity of the species (Flux and Fullagar 1992, Thompson and King 1994). The European Rabbit occurs in a wide variety of habitats, and it is usually found below 1,500 m in elevation in its native range (Fa <em>et al</em>. 1999), although in Tenerife (Canary Islands) it is extremely abundant over 3,000 m (&gt;7.5 rabbits/ha; Cubas <em>et al.</em> 2018).",This is an important game species.&#160;Domesticated forms are important pet animals and are also used in labs for experiments.,Terrestrial,"Important Conservation Actions Needed:<br/><br/>Conservation for the  European Rabbit was delayed for several decades after their decline  became apparent. Efforts began to take shape in the late 1980's due to  previous political isolation of its native range and the lack of  information on the species as a keystone to Iberian ecosystems. The  issue of eradication of European Rabbits from introduced areas (e.g.  Australia, New Zealand, and many islands) may have diminished the  appearance of rabbit decline in its native range. Increased interest in  the specialist predators that depend upon the rabbits and the issue of  the sustainability of hunting populations brought the species into the  public eye, but failed to address some issues of rabbit conservation,  such as its role as an ecosystem modeler and the effects of habitat loss  on populations (Gibb 1990, Ward 2005).<br/><br/>Ward's (2005) report was  key to highlighting the threats associated with the European Rabbit, and  outlined specific goals needed to achieve rabbit recovery:<br/><ul><li>Establish rabbit monitoring programs to accurately describe decline directly.</li></ul><ul><li>Create and implement a management plan for rabbit recovery that  prioritizes critical ranges and populations. Rabbit management plans  started long ago, although they were embedded in the recovery plans of  other species, such as the Imperial Eagle or Iberian Lynx. This  situation continues in many areas, and this goal attempts to ensure  dedicated plans to conserve European Rabbits.</li></ul><ul><li>Programs to limit  the incidence and impact of new and existing diseases may be difficult  in the wild, though some success has been observed in captive  populations. Current vaccines do not confer total immunity to RHD or  myxomatosis, have side effects such as increasing rabbit stress and  vulnerability to predators, and have short-lived effectiveness. In  addition, the need to vaccinate rabbits individually in the field is  unmanageable. Any genetically modified live virus vaccine is  controversial because of the possibility of unpredictable evolution of  the virus, and its potential spread to rabbit populations outside the  natural range of European Rabbits where eradication, not conservation,  is the objective. Increasing habitat quality may indirectly help rabbit  disease resistance given that it is known that high density populations  respond better to disease outbreak (Calvete 2006, Cotilla <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Guerrero-Casado <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Controlling disease vectors for myxomatosis has not been found  to be effective. Preventing the spread of modified immune-contraceptive  viruses engineered in Australia to control rabbit fertility may become  an issue.</li></ul><ul><li>Reducing hunting impact is not guaranteed to reduce  decline because disease effects often outweigh hunting as a threat, and  because implementation of restrictions would likely not be realistic  given the prevalence of hunting in Iberia, where in many areas their  management strategies are even more effective than the ones carried out  in some protected areas to enhance rabbit populations (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2009b). Revisions to existing hunting seasons have been proposed, but  only some small changes have been tested. Probably, a greater  distinction between hunting regulations should exist between areas where  rabbits are in decline and agricultural areas where the species is  damaging crops, in spite that there are more legal facilities to hunt  rabbits in the latter. A growing recognition among hunters of the issue  of rabbit decline has led to frequent self-restraint (Angulo and  Villafuerte 2003). As a very large demographic, hunters could represent a  powerful force in maintaining sustainable hunting populations.</li></ul><ul><li>Rabbit populations affected by agriculture represent a sensitive issue,  as rabbits are typically seen as a pest and an economic liability for  farmers. Despite pressures from environmental groups, many farmers and  hunters continue to take measures to reduce rabbit numbers even in  agro-forestry areas where the species plays key ecological roles.  Awareness among farmers and hunters of rabbit conservation issues is  generally low. Government policy allows hunters to control rabbits in  farmland areas with permits (Ríos-Saldaña <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010),  and though crop loss due to rabbit damage in some cases is economically  payed through insurance, no requirement of those compensated is made for  conservation.</li></ul><ul><li>Halting and reversing habitat loss and  fragmentation was aided in the past decades by the establishment of  national parks in Spain, but most optimal rabbit habitat is on private  land (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009b). A shift from  high-intensity farming and monoculture forestry back to mixed  agro-forestry and small scale farming would help sustain rabbit  populations (Calvete <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2010). Natura 2000 promotion of sustainable development and EU  subsidies supporting environmentally friendly agriculture are promising  but underfunded and too new to demonstrate a significant impact.  Importantly, land abandonment in mountain regions has resulted in the  encroachment of forests and scrubland, which is detrimental for rabbits  (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). In these places, promoting  open areas (i.e. pastures or small scale farming) through scrub  clearance is essential to increase food availability for rabbits (Moreno  and Villafuerte 1995).</li></ul><ul><li>Reintroductions have been a key focus  of conservation efforts, with up to 500,000 released annually in Spain  and France. The efforts so far have not increased rabbit populations in  most cases, due to the unappropriated selection of the animals to be  released and increased mortality from predation and inadvertent spread  of disease, which may actually have a net negative impact. The flaws in  reintroduction practices do not completely negate the importance of the  efforts, which have been shown to help sustain predators and hunting  populations at least locally (e.g. Rouco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Guerrero-Casado <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2013). The success of reintroductions may be increased by fencing from  predators and competitors and preventing short-term dispersal in  addition to providing feeding resources (Rouco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).</li></ul><ul><li>Though rabbit predators have not directly caused rabbit decline,  factors that have caused initial decline (e.g. disease, habitat loss)  may be exacerbated by some opportunistic predators (Fernández de Simón <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2015). Game keeping efforts to increase rabbit populations often focus  on predator reduction, and sometimes predators of conservation concern  are affected because non-selective practices are used (e.g.  cage-trapping or poisoning). Efforts could be more productively focused  on increasing habitat protection (e.g. building artificial rabbit  warrens), reduction of rabbit mortality by humans (hunting,  inappropriate management practices) and reducing disease impacts.</li></ul><br/>The  importance of the European Rabbit within its natural range requires  that it be considered for listing in spite of its global abundance. In  its original range it is a keystone to the Mediterranean ecosystem, as  prey for specialist predators (Virgos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and as a landscape modeler (Galvez-Bravo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). It is an important game species in Spain and Portugal (Delibes-Mateos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014a).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
